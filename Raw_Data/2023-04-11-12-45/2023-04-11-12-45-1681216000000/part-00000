{"review_id": "136518027", "app_id": "2151770", "review_text": "Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.\n\nThe main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.\n\nThe unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. \n\nAdditionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don\u2019t work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.\n\nThree keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. \n\nYou keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.\n\nThe reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn\u2019t there because you simply can\u2019t afford a better gun at the start. \n\nThe game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each \"floor\" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there\u2019s enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter.", "label": 1}
