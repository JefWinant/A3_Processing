{"review_id": "119682629", "app_id": "1729900", "review_text": "Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.\nTLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game.", "label": 0}
