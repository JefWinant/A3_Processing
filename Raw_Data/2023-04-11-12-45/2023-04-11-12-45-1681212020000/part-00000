I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration.\n\n I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. \n\nI want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.\n\nThis is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)\n\ngood\n+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. \n+ The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.\n\nneutral\n= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.\n= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.\n= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. \n\nbad (these are really really minor issues)\n- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.\n- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.\n- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.\n\n------ Level Times\n01 - 00:58:802\n02 - 00:51:566\n03 - 00:48:949\n04 - 00:51:485\n05 - 00:55:513\n06 - 00:54:914\n07 - 00:41:248\n08 - 00:41:320\n09 - 00:58:073\n10 - 00:48:492", "label": 1}
