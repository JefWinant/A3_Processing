They are all so adorable and sweet. The puzzles are easy but not boring, and the music is relaxing and soothing. I feel like I\u2019m in a kawaii paradise when I play this game. \ud83d\udc95\n\nThe best part is that there are so many catgirls to choose from, and they all have different personalities and styles. I can\u2019t decide which one is my favorite. Maybe the pink one with the glasses, or the blue one with the bow. They are all so purrfect! \ud83d\ude3b\n\nThis game is a must-play for anyone who loves cats, anime, or just cute things in general. It will make you smile and melt your heart. I give it 5 stars and two paws up! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\udc3e", "label": 1}
