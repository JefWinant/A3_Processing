The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)\n\nOverall If you're really into bullet hell, this game is a must have. It's really fun and its tracks are absolute bangers.", "label": 1}
