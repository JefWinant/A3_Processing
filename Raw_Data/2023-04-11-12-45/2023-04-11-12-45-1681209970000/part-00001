{"review_id": "121230865", "app_id": "1729900", "review_text": "Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.\n\nFirst off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. \n\nAlong with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game.", "label": 0}
