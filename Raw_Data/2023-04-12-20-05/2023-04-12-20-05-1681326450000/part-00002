First of all, there should be some kind of tutorial at the begining to tell me what the heck is going on. Secondly, I guess something is happening at the game as you play, like earthquakes, and buildings being destroyed like its nothing. There is no animation of these buildings collapsing at all, that it seems like a bug.\nAnyways, this is still an early access game, so I could give another chance when it is completely done.", "label": 0}
