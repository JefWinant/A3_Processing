[b]no move limit or rating system[/b], just wreak havoc and move on. the enemy usually also has an arsenal and they're on the same 'timer' that can and should be used to your advantage, along with the game's self-admitted 'not necessarily realistic' physics. it's worth noting that enemy units only activate if there's something to shoot at (they're not bothered by your ballistas because triggering those would destroy their own things) and [b]your goal is to destroy enemy castles, but no problem if other stuff gets demolished too[/b]. maybe those tall towers with red flags are a third party and acceptable collateral damage.\n\nI figured with new additions introduced so often, most levels would feel like tutorials, but of course accumulated knowledge has to be used on later puzzles with more and more things, so it's not all a breeze, not for me anyway, and not that much filler either. [b]a puzzle skip option would be nice[/b], so if you get stuck, you're not stuck for good, though somebody's bound to make a guide at some point. level 17 caused the first real problem for me, had to sleep on it, and there were tricky situations later on as well, clever little thing. I gave up on level 30 for now, will try again if they fix the camera, look at this zoomed-in nonsense.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961080510\n\nI really like the presentation but [b]wouldn't mind weather toggles[/b] (clouds, falling snow). no on-screen level numbers ever is always a shame, here it's only on the level select screen. settings are okay and also available while playing, resolutions, windowed mode, languages, graphics quality, an all-important [b]screen shake toggle[/b], and only a single volume slider because [b]there is no music[/b]. surely kevin macleod, composer of all royalty-free music in the world, has some medieval stuff. unfortunately, [b]progress is stored in the registry[/b], which isn't covered by cloud support.\n\nit's [b]fun and satisfying, watching things fall apart[/b] (as long as it's not your own life), the [b]level editor with workshop support[/b] might provide longevity if the game gains popularity, and there's even a slight educational element, at least there was for me. catapult, trebuchet, same same, but not anymore. if controls and the camera got some love (it should be 100% mousable and non-qwerty-friendly), it'd be even better, until then it's [b]only recommended on sale[/b].", "label": 1}
