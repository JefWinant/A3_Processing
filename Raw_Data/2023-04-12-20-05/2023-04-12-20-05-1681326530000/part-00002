While one could criticise the lack of some equipment (helmets) and sometimes balance issues, you can't deny there is a feeling of adventure in there. You will have to explore a lot, fight a lot, do not starve, go hunting, fishing, mining, stealing, try to find your path. You may take a bandit as a prisonner, and then free him; or whip him to death; or kiss him; or make him your captain; or cut him in pieces and eat him; or perhaps all of these ? I'll give it a try\nA lot of options to customize your party, builds and gear, your overall gameplay with more challenging difficulties and starting areas. I like the graphics, the storytelling, the minigames (best of all is the Rouste !!), the way you have to think ahead to build your group as a whole with professions (WHAAATT ? A BARD ??? Yes, my lord, a bard, what song do you want ?).\nShiro Games is a company based in my town, I think someday I'll go visit them and pay them my thanks (with a bottle of Edoran wine) for giving me 142,1 hours of good time so far", "label": 1}
