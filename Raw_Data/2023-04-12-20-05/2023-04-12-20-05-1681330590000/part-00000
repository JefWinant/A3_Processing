I loved the characters and the story, and wanted to play through this story to get every little detail and outcome.\n\n However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder.\n\n To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.  \n\nThe music was top notch, and the story had me so involved I wished the puzzles were not in the game. overall worth it and I hope to give it another go in a couple days.", "label": 1}
