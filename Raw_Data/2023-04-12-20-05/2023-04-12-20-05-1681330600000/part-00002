It's pretty short so you can do multiple playthroughs to see what happens if you choose differently.\nI'm not super familiar with the Tron universe, so some of the lore is lost on me, but I feel like it made it even better for me.  \nI didn't know who to trust or what to believe, or who was aligned with whom, but the game does a good job at explaining things and giving context, so I never felt lost or overwhelmed. \nThe writing is good, the visuals are great, the music gives a cool vibe.\nOverall, if you like visual novels, this is a safe purchase and a good experience. \n", "label": 1}
