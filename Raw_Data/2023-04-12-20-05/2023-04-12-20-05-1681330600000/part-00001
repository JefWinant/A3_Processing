Fast forward to April 2023: I'm downloading, playing and soaking the game in. It does a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere and vibe of The Grid. The story is captivating and the puzzles in between are a nice change. Oh and the visuals with the music... I could just stare at them for hours!\n\nIt is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.\nAlso, they are working on more Tron projects and I am totally here for the ride! End of line.", "label": 1}
