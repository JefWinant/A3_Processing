I never write reviews until Im done with a game but oh god does this  game feel great. I've been a fan of the metroidvania genre since I played Zero Mission on the gba, we were a bit scrapped for titles for a few years and i was left replaying the older castlevania games mostly. Then came Hollow knight, and absolute masterpiece that reignited my love for the genre like never before and showed a level of care, love and brilliance I'd never seen among it's peers.\n\nSince then I've been feeling that itch every few months, a nothing that came out could quite scratch it; Hollow knight inspired games that didn't quite hit the spot and felt just serviceable. Games that might have good exploration, combat or movement but didn't quite bring it all together in my experience. This game is doing it: I'ts fresh, innovative, well designed and above all, it gives you tools to be extremely creative in how you play any given situation. The hook is not a gimmick like in some other games, it's momentum based and a core element of how you're supposed to traverse levels and approach combat, you can even hook enemies that tend to stay away to blast them with your guns. \n\nPlot seems interesting, it starts in media res and you start learning about the world characters and your background as you go. Music is good, art is great and the level design seems outstanding. I'll update this when I finish the game, but for now I say: If you're a fan of this genre and you're on the fence about this, just give it a chance, it deserves it.", "label": 1}
