Yeah, you can play short missions against bots, they are not as good as Insurgency, but again, not bad for a free game.\nAs far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.\nHigher level characters seem to be a bit better, but I haven't played enough to know how good/bad the balance is. \n\nSo for now I'd say give it a go, I've seen worse multiplayer offerings than this, though I am not sure how long will the gunplay hold your interest.", "label": 1}
