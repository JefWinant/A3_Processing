{"review_id": "136586716", "app_id": "307950", "review_text": "So, I do have a metric sh*tton of hours on the game, but on the launcher. Happy to see it come to Steam! If you are fans of Ghost Recon: Phantoms or the Old SOCOM games, you NEED to try this one out! It's completely free!\n\nVideo Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqzr2Xob1R0\n\nPros\n- Almost 70 Operators to Choose from, leading to huge gameplay shifts between matches\n- Visuals look awesome on Characters, Maps and Weapons\n- Both PVP and PVE modes (PVE in co-op too) so it has something for everyone!\n- Map design is simple, but allows for traversal of a few different flank routes\n- No longer P2W, with the vast majority of Monetization Options tied to Cosmetics and Emotes\n- Developers who Actually listen to player feedback\n\nCons\n- There is still a lot of Monetization Options, which get confusing looking through all of the menus\n- Operator Balancing still needs a bit of work (Explosive Flying Drones and Invulnerable Operators need nerfing)\n- The time between Battle Passes makes it impossible to get certain Operators without waiting until the next Pass, which may not be for a month or two. Just make them back to back like EVERY. OTHER. GAME. EVER. So we can then get the last season Ops sooner. Weird choice.", "label": 1}
