Couldn't start a game after getting through the 'tutorial' which is nothing more than a sequence of screenshots outside the game. Basically a man page. Not to mention you can't click on anything in the main window, and it completely destroys your multi-monitor layout, moving windows around randomly, resizing stuff and all sorts. Just no. Seems to be completely untested so don't bother with it.", "label": 0}
