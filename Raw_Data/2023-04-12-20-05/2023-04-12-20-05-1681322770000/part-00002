I think it's got great potential because of the multiplayer aspect, my clan is one of the top 10 in the game right now but I'm having more fun playing an idle game WITH people than I ever had with single player ones. Bear in mind I'm a mmo and idle game addict so this does just kinda slot right into my niche but it's still fun and has a good future if the dev continues improving it. Notic how I said \"dev\" and not \"devs\" - from what I've seen it's all one dude making this game", "label": 1}
