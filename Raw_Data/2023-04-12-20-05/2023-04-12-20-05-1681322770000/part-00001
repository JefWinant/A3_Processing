It is running, it has some flaws and needs some features.\n\nNow to the review:\nThe game is good. It is a lot of fun. It is basically Melvor Idle with MMO aspects. You can trade with players, you have clans, you can chat ingame.\nThis game is a lot of fun once you get into it and start understanding the full extend. (So after 5h when you need that long)\nYES there is a premium you can buy for 10$ once. There are other boosts you can buy, that are for X hours. But development and server costs should be accounted for by something I would say.\n\nThe Discord is very active, a lot of helpfull people are there. The Discord is the main communication tool for the game and I suggest it for every player.\n\nOther from that? A fun game. It is basically Melvor Idle in MMO. If you like it because of that, is up to you.", "label": 1}
