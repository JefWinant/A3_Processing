{"review_id": "136585742", "app_id": "1118110", "review_text": "Ok I really wanted to like this game and was looking forward to it.  I have well over the required minimum specs and it runs terrible on my pc.  Don't even get me started about the loading screens....I could literally drink an entire cup of coffee at my leisure.  I DO recommend this game after they have done a lot of work on it as it WILL be a great game at THAT time.  Right now I would hold off until they put some hours into fixing/improving it.   This game does have great potential.  I mean I played the demo and it was a blast although I did have a few issues, but it's like the release version went backwards.  Even though i'm rather disappointed, I will be keeping my eye on this one and would love to repurchase it later.", "label": 0}
