I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], and I enjoyed the mobile game <Maximus 1>, <Super Boys - The Big Fight> and <Black Moor 2> a lot.\n\nFirst of all, it's so good that this game was released on Steam itself, but it seems like it needs constant updates like someone else's opinion. Even if this game doesn't have a point store, I'd like to at least have an achievements or trading card. Also, the full screen didn't apply, so I felt awkward while playing... I agree with others.\n\nIn other words, I've been waiting for the release of this game for quite a long time, but I don't know the difference with the mobile version. I'm upset that I don't feel rewarded as much as I waited, but on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], so I'll continue to play happily. I sincerely hope one day <Black Moor 2> or the old game <Maximus 1> etc. will be released on Steam! Thank you for reading the long article!", "label": 1}
