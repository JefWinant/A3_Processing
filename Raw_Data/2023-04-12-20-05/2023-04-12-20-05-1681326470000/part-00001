What I really like about this game is the aesthetics and the unique gamplay idea. Each island you're on gets gradually flooded, which means that you have less space to build and need to be smart about building placement. Biomes have different features, so you have to adjust your strategy to individual conditions. You also get different commanders and relics (items) that help you with the challenge. The screen may sometimes get crowded and with many buildings on the island you may need to pay extra attention when moving around, but other than that it's a really fun an enjoyable game! Also, there are 2 modes other than campaign available, but I haven't tried them yet.", "label": 1}
