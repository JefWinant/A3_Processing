That's actually a good thing.\n\nThis game is legit. I can't sing it's praises enough.\n\nIs it next gen? Nah\n\nIs it something you can't miss? Nah.\n\nBut you would still be doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out.\n\nYou're island shrinks slowly but surely and you needed to accomplish enough objectives so you can move on to the next island, rinse and repeat. Now while it sounds simple and hell...the gameplay is pretty simple for the most part. The game is so well made that I can't get mad at it.\n\nIt's addictive, it's engaging, it's mysterious, it's challenging (But in a good way) and overall it's just really fun.\nProbably 6-12 hours of gameplay here (depending on how much you wanna play or accomplish) and for 13 dollars, this kind of gameplay and stability it's a great offer.\n\nI Highly recommend this game and even if this isn't normally your type of game I'd still recommend you check it out. \nIt's a resource gathering, upgrade buildings and build up defenses against pirates kinda game. It plays really well, has a decent tutorial and a decent story with everything else about this game being almost perfect for what kind of game it is.\nBut if that still wasn't enough then please check out the video on my YouTube channel (link below) for a more in depth look at the game.\n\nOtherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9cqUYS22us", "label": 1}
