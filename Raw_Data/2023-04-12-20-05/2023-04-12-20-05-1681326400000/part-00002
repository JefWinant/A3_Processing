This results in 300 ping games and while I can deal with it and have some fun not everyone else will be willing to do the same. I wouldn't even bother asking anyone to download and play it with me because no one will say yes to 300 ping games. Add Asia/Oceania servers if you want these regions to play your game.", "label": 0}
