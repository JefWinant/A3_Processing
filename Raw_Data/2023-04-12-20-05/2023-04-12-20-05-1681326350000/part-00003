I've not yet won a run, with only a few making it past the first boss, but I don't feel frustrated or like i'm making no progress. Not to mention how cute the art style is! This is definitely a game i'm personally gonna sink a lot of hours into and I can't wait to see how it and the community grows!", "label": 1}
