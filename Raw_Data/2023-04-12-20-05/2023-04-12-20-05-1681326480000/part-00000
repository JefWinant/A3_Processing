Hope this game goes places.\n\nIt's very story driven, which isn't a slight but I do hope thats a product of the demo, and in the final product there will be more... mundane store stuff.\n\noverall a pretty cozy game about running a repair shop with a killer soundtrack.\nOne of the characters says that the main character should open a coffee shop.. not a bad idea for a game of this nature.", "label": 1}
