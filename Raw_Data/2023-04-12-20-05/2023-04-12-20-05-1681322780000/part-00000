The gameplay is mostly fine, too: some combat-related frustrations aside, I had fun playing detective, solving cool puzzles and sneaking around as I looked for answers and appreciated all the little details of the setting. However, what ultimately prevents me from giving this one a strong recommendation is the underdeveloped and clich\u00e9-ridden story, the generally poorly written dialogue and the inconclusive, unsatisfying ending that all hold the project back from reaching its full potential.\n\nFor more honest indie game reviews, check out our Curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6481290-GTOGG/", "label": 1}
