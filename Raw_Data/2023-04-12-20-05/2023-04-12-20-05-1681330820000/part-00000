It's a very competent turn based strategy and managing your party is simple, but still provides a good challenge when it comes to weighing up who gets healed, who's armour are you going to fix, will you devote some of your precious resources to crafting certain items etc. I had a lot of fun, I put just short of 30 hours in pre-1.0 and I'm sure I'll put in a lot more now it's fully released", "label": 1}
