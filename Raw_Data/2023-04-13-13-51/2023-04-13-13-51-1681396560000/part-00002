{"review_id": "131242928", "app_id": "2077590", "review_text": "Feels like a frustration simulator. Random attacks magically appear at increasing frequency through the waves, leading up to the final wave being an onslaught of BS moves that CC you, with the ability to default attack enemies or use the healing move being tied to standing still - which is impossible at this point. Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. \n\nThere are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours.", "label": 0}
