[/h1]\n\nIf you have any experience at Roguelike Deckbuilders you will enjoy the game just fine. \n\nPeople whining that the game is difficult and unbalanced just don't know how to adapt to the challenge thrown at them. For reference, I finished a run on my 2nd attempt without any meta progress unlocks. While i understand people are frustrated because they have a tough time making progress, this doesn't warrant a negative review, otherwise all Souls-like games would be downvoted to oblivion. \n\nSome enemy decks will counter what you are building and the fight may be tough, but not unwinnable. I disagree on so many exaggerated claims made by various reviews that i wonder why they are playing a game from this genre in the first place.", "label": 1}
