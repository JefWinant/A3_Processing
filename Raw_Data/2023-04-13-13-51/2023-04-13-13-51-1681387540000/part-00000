Sometimes I get a hero so broken I don't even need to think or synergize at all to win. Other times no matter how much you plan everything out you have already lost the run because of bad RNG and you just didn't know it yet. Getting familiar with the gameplay didn't seem to mattered much. Felt like it was 80% luck to win.", "label": 1}
