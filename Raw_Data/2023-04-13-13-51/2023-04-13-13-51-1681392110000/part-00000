Those are from people who bought tables years ago and feel entitled to get the completely remastered, re-engineered versions for free and are now spamming the reviews for the new platform with unjustified hate.\n\nThe new Pinball FX is a HUGE improvement over the prior versions. 60 FPS and 4K resolution are reason enough to justify the upgrade!  Detail never before prominent on tables now pops in crystal clarity, and all movement is silky smooth. \n\nAll the customization and unlockables and new game modes are icing on the cake. What are you waiting for?!?!?", "label": 1}
