I'm sure the balancing is a little wonky, but this game was obviously designed to make you earn every fight.  I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.  I also haven't won a run yet, but I'm excited to get home from work and give it another go.  Maybe the devs should consider adding an easy mode for the whiners?", "label": 1}
