I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.\n\nThe gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.\n\nGraphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.\n\nI see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.\n\nIt is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle. Personally I'm not a good player at all, I'm just a masochist, haha.
