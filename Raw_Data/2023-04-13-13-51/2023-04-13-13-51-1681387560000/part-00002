Art is just Beautiful!\n\nI had the opportunity receive early access and have now have played over 30 hours!\n\nOnly completing my first run after 15 hours but at no point did i feel disheartened and i enjoyed the challenge.\n\nAbsolutely love the variety of factions and characters with enough different mechanics that each run feels different and constantly working towards achievable meta progression goals.\n\nLike most deckbuilders the mechanics at times can seem overwhelming but taking your time with turns definitely pays off.\n\n", "label": 1}
