{"review_id": "136622947", "app_id": "2109430", "review_text": "Fun short story in the Tron space. The setting lends itself well to interesting philosophical though. The game touches on some of that but mostly leave space for the player to think about it and as such I am sure this appeals more to the type of player who wants to replay and discover all of the possible dialogs/options.\n\nThe minigame is simple but fairly easy to learn but never got super far into the digital design space - feels like a paper prototype that just worked well enough to be fun. As a whole the game shows restraint and never oversteps its bounds but as a Tron fan and a fan of the studio I would have been on board for something deeper if that is something they ever get the chance to go for.", "label": 1}
