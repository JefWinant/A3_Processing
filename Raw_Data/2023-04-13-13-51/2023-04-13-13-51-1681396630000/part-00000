{"review_id": "136629194", "app_id": "1364020", "review_text": "I've only played this game for like half an hour and i can already say that i love it!\n\nThere are some issues, small bugs and glitches like buttons not working and stuttering that occur sometimes, but the game was only released to early access a few hours ago so its not a big deal.\n\nFirst off i've got to address the sound design which is absolutely amazing, for example the sounds from outside of your helmet are muffled in a fantastic way. Gun sound powerful and the boosters make my ears moan.\n\"but space doesn't have any sound\" you're free to take off your headset at any time, you'll see how fun that'll be.\n\nThe Graphics are really good too, not out of this world but not bad either.\n\nThe Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.\nThe movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.\n\n\nOverall i think this game has great potential. With just some polishing, frequent updates and a steady playercount i can see this game become quite popular amongst FPS and space enjoyers.", "label": 1}
