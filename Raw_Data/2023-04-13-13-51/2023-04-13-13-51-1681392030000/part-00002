This is not a very good co-op game because you can't do anything independently. If he clicks on a merchant, I get the box. If I close that box, it closes on his end. It's basically co-op in the sense that we might as well be a the same computer playing the same game. The art looks like those old point and click flash games. It might get better later, but there's a 2 hour return policy so I stopped playing just under that mark to get my money back.", "label": 0}
