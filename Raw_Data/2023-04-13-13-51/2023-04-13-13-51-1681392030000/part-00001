{"review_id": "136621775", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "Very buggy. Keeps opening in the wrong monitor, doesn't seem to recognize which monitor is monitor 1-3 but also upon loading or quitting shuffles everything on monitor 1 to monitors 2 or 3. No other game or program does this so it's obviously something to do with this game. On top of that it locks up and crashes often. Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. \n\nWait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle. Also at least one farm in the starting zone doesn't have an exit.... Hope you enjoy replaying the last autosaved battle.", "label": 0}
