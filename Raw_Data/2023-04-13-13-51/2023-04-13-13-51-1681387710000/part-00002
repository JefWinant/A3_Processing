Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.\n\nAnd they also sell coins that you can use to purchase monthly and yearly subscriptions. Yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to a pinball service, sure. Good luck selling this one, ZEN Studios, I'm not gonna be part of it this time.", "label": 0}
