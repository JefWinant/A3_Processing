They have built a better Pinball FX3, and technically the latest installment is superior to its predecessors in almost every way. Additionally, they now include instant access to Cabinet Mode, which works well for owners of Virtual Pinball Cabinets. There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! \n\nThe biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. \n\nIt's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. \n\nIn the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\ud83c\udfaeeeFoGee\ud83c\udfae\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42825155/] Factor of Games Curator Page[/url]", "label": 1}
