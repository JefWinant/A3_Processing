No/low fantasy is great too, as some people just don't need or want another game with loads of drags, mages, and manna.  \nThe graphics are good, and while there are probably a few things that could be polished in v1.0 (i.e. unit pathing), this is a really enjoyable game. Plenty of surprises along the way!", "label": 1}
