You will often run into a wall of enemies your team can't fight because you don't have the one specific card type that counters them.\n\nExample: Third fight in the run. I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:\n\nGot a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health. \n\nI can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me. I just lose.\n\nThe art/sound is 11/10. Should have been early access to get balanced properly before 1.0.", "label": 0}
