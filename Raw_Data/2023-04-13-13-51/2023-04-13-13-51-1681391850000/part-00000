So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience \n\nSet in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.\n\nThe game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.\n\nOverall a great time and i hope there is more to come", "label": 1}
