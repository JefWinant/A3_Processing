{"review_id": "136619307", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "I've got all of 100 minutes into the game and so far it feels pretty good, I think monster train is the most apt comparison I  can make for it, and whereas people say the RNG is brutally punishing I'm either super lucky to have made it nearly to the end in 2-3 runs (or I didn't and I don't realize how long the game is...) overall I like how the game feels. But so far devs have done an excellent job on the game! It's a gorgeous game, and it's a good time, I want to see it do well because the Devs have clearly poured a lot of heart into this game, and it is truly excellent.", "label": 1}
