I would place this game on the same level as those games easily, and especially if they address some of the issues I mention below. \n\nThe game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.\n\nI will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:\n- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.\n- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.\n- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.\n- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.\n- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.\n\nI really hope they plan on making balance changes. The game is easily worth $20 regardless, though!", "label": 1}
