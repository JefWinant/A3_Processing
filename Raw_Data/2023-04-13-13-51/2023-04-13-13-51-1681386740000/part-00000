{"review_id": "136616532", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Summary of the negative reviews: \"Waah the hard card game is too difficult >:(\". To address the negative reviews seriously. They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.\n\nMy experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.\n\nPros\n- Absolutely charming art\n- Fun characters\n- Unique and interesting card roguelike format\n- Card effects feel varied and unique\n\nCons\n- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards", "label": 1}
