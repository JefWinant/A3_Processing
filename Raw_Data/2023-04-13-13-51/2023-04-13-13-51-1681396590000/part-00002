Couple of fun different builds you can go for, my favourite so far is ADC.\nThe game could need a score board, to make it easier to be competitive. My world record, as recognised by the discord community, stands undefeated so far though.\nGot a few maps left to play, and more builds to try out, but still recommend the game. Well worth the cost.", "label": 1}
