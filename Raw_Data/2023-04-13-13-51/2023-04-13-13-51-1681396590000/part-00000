{"review_id": "130571366", "app_id": "2077590", "review_text": "This is such a great twist (or should I say *sidestep*) to the arena survival genre formula. You have to strategize your in-run upgrades to create a balanced build that will allow you to have just the right amount of offense combined with defense and mobility to be able to survive the bullet hell. Lots of starting skills and they all combine and synergize with each other to create more unique skills. There's also meta-upgrades, characters and maps to unlock that makes for good replayability. The kind of game that really compels you to do \"just one more run\".\n\nSome gameplay here - https://youtu.be/f60rqswr7CQ", "label": 1}
