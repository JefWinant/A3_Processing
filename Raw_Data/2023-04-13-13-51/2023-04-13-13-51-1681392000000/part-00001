The design of the game seemed quite unique to me because we are building a town with cards! Honestly, i am not very keen on in card games but the board game-like gameplay of this game sounds interesting to me. I played it 15 hours until now and i want to say that: The game is better than i expect. The first hours of the game may be difficult for you but after you realize some mechanichs of the game it will be more delightful. \n There are so many combos you can do with using cards and upgrades, so many different ways to build your town. You will be discovering all of them while playing.\n Considering it's an early access original indie game, i strongly recommend you to buy this game.\n\n Finally, i want to thank all the great people behind the project. Good luck with your upcoming games!", "label": 1}
