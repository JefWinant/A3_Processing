What about people using very modern 2in1 that could be played portray mode on that device.\nOh and people are annoyed that Steam price of table are higher that Epic Games especially in different part of the world.\n\nLast few people are saying the flipper feel more like jelly, all i can say is I be loosing the ball more offer compared to FX3 but that could just be me.\n\nSo you added improvement that seem to benefit desktop user the most in FX on steam launch now add the right one that also benefit Steam Deck and PS5/XBOX as well. Thanks", "label": 1}
