While there are many actions happening in every turn, all enemy actions are telegraphed multiple turns ahead and once you understand the order in which they are executed, you can plan accordingly.  All those negative reviews criticising the balancing aspect are imo by players who do not enjoy this planning and don't do it thoroughly enough as it is easy to overlook something (which may even get you killed). In 4 hours I played 4 runs, won 2 of them, and died once to the final boss and once midway through. Balancing seems fine. Or maybe I am just lucky :P\n\nIf I were to criticise something its that the different abilities / status effects are not explained ideally so some interactions are initially uncleaer. This fixes itself with some more experience though.", "label": 1}
