The look, sound, and feel are all perfect. It puts a new, highly addictive spin on the deckbuilder genre. It is hard and needs balance, but even in its current state, it\u2019s flat out a blast to play and we\u2019ll worth $20. Most importantly, it plays flawlessly on Steam Deck with controller support, which is a rarity for deckbuikders.", "label": 1}
