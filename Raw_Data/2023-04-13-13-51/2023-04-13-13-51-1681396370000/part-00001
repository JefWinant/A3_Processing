{"review_id": "136623144", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "This game has a lot of good ideas and fantastic art and music, but it's fundamentally let down by extreme RNG.\n\nIn most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.\n\nThis game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need. \nAs a result, the \"rebuild and restrategise\" that's advertised, just isn't there. You roll the dice again and hope you get lucky.", "label": 0}
