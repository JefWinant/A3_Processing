Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole \"New Orleans\"-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.\n\nNow the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.\nMay I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.\n\nAnd then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.\n\nLast Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.\n\n2/10 but only because the game looks nice\n\n", "label": 0}
