{"review_id": "136623974", "app_id": "307950", "review_text": "(This Review is more in the middle than a simple yes or no)\n\nJust gonna say first of all this game is fun gameplay is actually really good but I decided to calculate how long it would take to collect all operators that are available for purchase through just the daily challenges as I have yet to unlock the weekly challenges or any of that so will update this accordingly when I get to that point. And as a addition this is without unlocking any operator upgrades or skills as the time would heavily differ\n\nCredits from daily objectives:\nNo Premium = 27,050\nPremium = 38,850\n\nTo get all operators for a class is:\n100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits\n150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits\n200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 credits\nAll together = 2,250,000 credits\n(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)\n\nSo to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)\nNon Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challenges\nPremium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challenges\n\nIf you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)\n\nPrices for coins:\n2,250 coins = $11.99\n5,000 coins = $23.99\n\nI get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a game\n\nLike I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 0}
