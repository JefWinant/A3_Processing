There are reduced puzzles, and more hand-holding in regards to deductions and observing, but the narrative makes up for it entirely, and I am slowly playing through it as I want to experience everything this game has to offer.\n\nThank you Frogwares, for giving us such a beautiful remake!", "label": 1}
