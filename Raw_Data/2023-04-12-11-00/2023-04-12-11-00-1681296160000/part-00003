{"review_id": "136565224", "app_id": "307950", "review_text": "(I have far more playtime through the standalone launcher prior to the Steam release.)\n\nFirst and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.\n\nIf you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.\n\nAs someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!", "label": 1}
