SOCOM? \nAny third person shooter that relies on teamwork?\n\nThis is game made for fans of that, if youre BF or CoD player coming here with \"Oh it doesnt have first person\" move along this aint for you anyway.\nAs a third person shooter this game has it everything you need to enjoy, while animations arent top notch like in GR Breakpoint, this game does it decent enough.\nGuns feel good and different.\nThere is one problem that new players might enncounter and that is famous grind.\nNew players might get overhelmed by amounnt of grind u need to put out, but this is better system thann it was before, where you would have to buy new operators only with gold (each week u would get 3 new operators that would b availeble for blue credits).\nAll to all - You like third person? You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!\n....and yeah, learn Russian!", "label": 1}
