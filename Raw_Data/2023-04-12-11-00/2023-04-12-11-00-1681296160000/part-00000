And what can I say about pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.\n+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.\n+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.\n+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).\n\nCons:\n-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.\n-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.\n\nSummary: good 'heroic shooter' in realistic setting with lots of coop and competitive activities. It's good to see it on Steam at last.", "label": 1}
