Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There\u2019s no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.\n\n As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn\u2019t enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.\n\n[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]\nYou\u2019ll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some \u201ccards\u201d belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting. \n\nThe sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the \u201cenchanted dimension\u201d, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won\u2019t even need a map for orienteering, and there isn\u2019t one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won\u2019t witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you\u2019ll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you\u2019ll have seen everything by then.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835\n\n[h3]Combat System[/h3]\nAt night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.\n\nYour choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn\u2019t have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft\u2019s combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.\n\n[h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3]\nYou\u2019ll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product. \n\nThere\u2019s no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft\u2019s diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won\u2019t need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn\u2019t worth it anyway.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780\n\n[h3]Trading & Farming[/h3]\nTraders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can\u2019t be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used. \n\nFarming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won\u2019t need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example.", "label": 0}
