Why would I sneak and craft vision-hindering arrows if I can solve every situation by just killing them? By giving the player a choice, they have honestly made it worse. The game wasnt designed for combat to begin with and it doesnt make alot of sense. The voice actress of Cynthia is extremly overplaying her part, sometimes it sounds good, sometimes its pretty cringe-worthy. \n\nNevertheless, this is still a good little indie gem, that is rough around the edges but has a ton of heart going for it. Just dont expect anything special. Would have loved to give this a mixed review, since it doesnt deserve a negative one but also not a positive one due to the whole combat situation. \n\nGerman first impressions: https://youtu.be/hTGyAx3LpDc", "label": 1}
