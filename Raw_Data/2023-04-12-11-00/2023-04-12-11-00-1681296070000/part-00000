Bought it the moment it went available and it has not disappointed at all.\n\nThe grapple hook is one of the best in the biz, feeling a lot like Umihara Kawase in the way that it acts a lot more like a bungee cord than something you'd see in a game like Bionic Commando.\nThe story so far has been really engaging and I want to know more and more about the world and characters. Soundtrack is great, and the world makes me want to go back to areas to see what I can do with new abilities.\n\nLegit the best Metroidvania I've played since Hollow Knight.", "label": 1}
