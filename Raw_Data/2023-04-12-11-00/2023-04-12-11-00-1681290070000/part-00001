{"review_id": "136560024", "app_id": "2156300", "review_text": "They clearly said Unscripted was going to different from their other game.  And it is.  It has more depth,  more characterization, more backstory, more interactions. Your MC has to actually work at developing a relationship with a female character  that wants more out of life. It's not a ridiculously stupid AVN,  which is the typical  visual novel genre,  but the audience for those stories are immature frat-boys or really damaged misogynists. It took just about two hour to play through the story,  and the price might be a little steep for the one chapter,  but if we're getting additional chapters later on,  it'll be worth the investment. The art is good and the dialogue writing is well developed as well.", "label": 1}
