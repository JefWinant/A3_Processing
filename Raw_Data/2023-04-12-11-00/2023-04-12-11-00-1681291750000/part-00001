The artwork is gorgeous, the characters intriguing, the puzzles are fun (usually), the soundtrack slaps, the writing is accessible while still keeping that Tron flavor, and best of all as soon as the credits roll I'm left wanting to know more. Here's hoping this is the neon noir beginning to a whole new era of Tron.\n\ntl;dr if you like Tron and you like visual novels, you will be delighted by this game", "label": 1}
