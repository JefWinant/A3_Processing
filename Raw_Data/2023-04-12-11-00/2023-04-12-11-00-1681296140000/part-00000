Everything is handcrafted to form the perfect roguelike deckbuilder experience.\nI know I don't have much time on the game currently, but I know I'll spend a lot of time playing this. I've been keeping up with this game for a REALLY long time. I am so glad to finally see it come to fruition.", "label": 1}
