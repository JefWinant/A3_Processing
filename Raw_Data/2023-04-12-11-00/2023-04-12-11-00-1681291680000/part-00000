Everything is maxed out and have not had any stutter or lag issues I have seen others report. Here is my take so far:\n\nPro:\n1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).\n2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.\n3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted space\n\nCons:\n1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.\n2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.\n3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore.\n 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:\n\nWorkers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.\n\nAnyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.", "label": 1}
