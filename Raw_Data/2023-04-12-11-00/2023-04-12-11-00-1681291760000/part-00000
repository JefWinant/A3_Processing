{"review_id": "136561253", "app_id": "2109430", "review_text": "It's a well-done short story that brings you back to the Grid.\n\nAll my criticisms are variations of \"I wish it was longer\" / \"I wish we got more time to know and interact with these characters\"; it was about a 3-hour playthrough my first time, and you can certainly speed through it much faster after you've gone through once. I think getting all the achievements today I played it 6 or 7 times total, doing all the puzzles each time, and altogether that took maybe 10 hours.\n\nIf you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).\n\nI'm still going to do another playthrough or two to see if there certain outcomes I can get, so yeah, I definitely recommend it!", "label": 1}
