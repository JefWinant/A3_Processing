If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big \"case\", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. \n\nIts adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable \"no right answer\" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.\n\nThe original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way.", "label": 1}
