I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the \"mobile game\" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. \n\nGraphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. \n\nTo all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. \n\nI never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. \n\nIt's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with \"story\" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. \n\nIt is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress.", "label": 1}
