Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsup\n\nIt's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. \n\nAnd this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it\u2019s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can\u2019t use axes\u2026 seriously?).\n\nThe other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn\u2019t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it\u2019s repetitive and boring.\n\nNevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that\u2019s worth 35 \u20ac EA for you\u2026 But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore. \n", "label": 0}
