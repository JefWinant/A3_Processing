{"review_id": "136575630", "app_id": "2156300", "review_text": "While I do like the game, it has barely any content.  The choices you have to make aren't clear (would be nice if there were HINTS on each choice as to what the result is instead of GUESSING!!).  You have no control for the most part over the ONLY sex scene it has and yep, no nudity.  I mean I see the promise this game has, but way too early to release with almost no content, no control over choices (meaning no hints) and VERY expensive for a game that is bare bones.  I would tell everyone wait until there's a final product before spending that much money for this.  Yes, lots of promise -- but its only a promise.  I should have waited for the final release with patches because I am sure a lot of people want to have hints on choices, not just \"guess\" as to the best answer.", "label": 0}
