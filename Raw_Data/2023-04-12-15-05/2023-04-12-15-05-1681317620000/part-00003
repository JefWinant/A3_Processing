Don't bother reading other reviews, try it now if you're into deckbuilders like Spire or Monster Train.\n\nGreat art, catchy music, fun monster designs. The gameplay is easy to pick up and learn but difficult to master. Very fast paced for a deckbuilder once you get the swing of things as well I think.", "label": 1}
