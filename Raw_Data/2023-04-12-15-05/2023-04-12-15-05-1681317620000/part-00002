There is a lot to discover / challenges to beat, but the meta progression focuses on unlocking new cards, rather than making things easier, which I really like.\n\nEvery roguelike deckbuilder will be compared to slay the spire, I guess, but the games feel way different. So even if you don't like StS, I think its worth giving a shot", "label": 1}
