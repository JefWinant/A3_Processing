I was waiting for this game for quite some time, so i'm glad I was able to play this before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recommend to you to play this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything was done perfectly. If you read it, thank you and good bye.", "label": 1}
