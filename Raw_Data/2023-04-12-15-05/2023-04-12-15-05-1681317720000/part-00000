The resource generation is almost non-existent while every other card is either a road or require 10 of a resource which you just lost due to not seeing a resource generation card in 5-10 turns.\n\noh wait, there goes a random event and you lose 1 of each resource now and lose. again.\n\nTried clicking the feedback button and was just taken to their socials links.\n\nNot sure leaving a comment on their Youtube page will help any.\n\nThe game is unique and enjoyable, after i turned the music down a bit. because it is nice and calm but them BAM TRUMPETS AND HORNS AND then it is calm and quiet again.\n\n", "label": 0}
