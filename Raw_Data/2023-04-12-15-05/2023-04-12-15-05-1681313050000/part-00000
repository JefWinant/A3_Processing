This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. \n\nStart by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. \n\nFor Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about \"a department\" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.\nStory: 8/10\n\nMove into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, \"stay calm while disguise\" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a \"quick action button\" so we don't need to try hard anymore. \nGameplay: 7,5/10\n\nThe graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n\nFinally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. \nSound: 7/10\n\nSo, in the end, the pros and cons of this game are\nPros:\n+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. \n+Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.\n+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues\n+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. \n+There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. \n\nCons: \n- Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.\n- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a \"quick action button\" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. \n- Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.\n- There is no manual saving\n\nOverall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!\n", "label": 1}
