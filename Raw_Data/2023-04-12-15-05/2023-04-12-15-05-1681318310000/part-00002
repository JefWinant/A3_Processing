Combats are a bit slower, but give more/different options.  The map is great, the stories are great, the combat is good, and the troop management is good.  Lots and lots of variety in builds and capabilities of different weapons.  Each region has an underlying story and decisions you can make to find your spot in the world.\n\nThere are still a few rough edges (it is Early Access), but I haven't noticed any bugs and it is still pretty darn fun.", "label": 1}
