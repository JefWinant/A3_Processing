{"review_id": "136576438", "app_id": "1498040", "review_text": "Very fun lil game. I'm certain there's a specific genre description for this type of gameplay, where you're just a lil dude constantly assaulted by waves upon waves of thousands of enemies & the goal is to wipe them out as efficiently as you can, but it's fun and satisfying.\n\nThis one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).\n\nQuite a ton of fun for the low low price. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something small to play around with between other things.", "label": 1}
