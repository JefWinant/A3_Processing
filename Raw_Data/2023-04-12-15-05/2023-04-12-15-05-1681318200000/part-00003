{"review_id": "114049736", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "Early access titles are usually hit or miss, and Wartales was definitely a hit.\n\nIt's the classic formula of \"build up a group of mercenaries\", where you do quests, earn money, recruit more mercs and make them stronger, then use that to complete harder quests. Other games that I'd compare it to are Battle Brothers and Mount&Blade.\n\nIt's not quite finished yet, and this is especially noticeable in UI/UX, some content, and balancing. However, the core systems are all there and really fun. Research and crafting is really cool, and the various progress systems (Comprendium, research, ...) are amazing in a game of this genre. Haven't encountered any bugs or crashes either. \n\nWould definitely recommend to everyone who's into turn-based combat :)", "label": 1}
