Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more \" DND \" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill \"and/or dice\" if you decide to implement that in the game.\n\nRunning on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P \n\nI also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. \n\nSome paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P\n\n SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! \n\nWhen you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. \n\nAlso the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch \"preperation hint\" was good :) \n\nAll in all, thats my look at the game so far, i like it and i hope it has a bright future :) \n\n\n", "label": 1}
