But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.\n\nThe runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.\nThe progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.\nCards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.\nThe art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.\n\nAnd if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?\nGive it a try. It's a great game.", "label": 1}
