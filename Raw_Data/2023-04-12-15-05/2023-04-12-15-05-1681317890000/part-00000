Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.\nMicromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.\n\nCannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play.", "label": 1}
