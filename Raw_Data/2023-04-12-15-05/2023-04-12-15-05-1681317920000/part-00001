Grab during a sale.\n\n\nThe fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. \n\nThe 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again. It's overpriced at $30, and I'd encourage nearly everyone to play Battle Brother instead, but it's worth a look if you can grab it during a sale.", "label": 1}
