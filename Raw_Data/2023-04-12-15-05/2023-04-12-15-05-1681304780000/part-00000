I never felt choices were forced on the player, and most (if not all) felt very much in character with the bios presented to the player. If you're a fan of visual novels this will be exactly what you're expecting, and if you're a fan of anything Tron this will definitely scratch the itch. It provides some new lore for the universe, and gives players the immersion into the universe that movies and traditional media cannot through the lack of agency.\n\nDefinitely recommend for a few hours more in the universe of Tron.", "label": 1}
