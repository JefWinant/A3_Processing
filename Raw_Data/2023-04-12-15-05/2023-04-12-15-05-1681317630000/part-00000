It deserves your attention if you like these types of games, or just roguelikes in general.\n\nAlso, the game isn't as hard as people say it is. I am horrible at these types of games and I got a win in the first 5 hours. You slowly learn what it is cool and what isn't, what is useful and which enemies are difficult.", "label": 1}
