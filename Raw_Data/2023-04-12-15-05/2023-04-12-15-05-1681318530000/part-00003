You found it!\n\nI will say combat in this is worse than in battle brothers, but that might change in the future. I have played the demo before early access and things have changed for the better already so I am confident they can find a way to make this game even better than it already is.\n\nEDIT: After going back to some Battle Brothers...Wartales has better combat imo. Cause it has no RNG. After such a long time of gaming and having played mainly chivalry and mordhau the last years I just can't stand these RNG systems anymore. So if you are annoyed at the RNG of battle brothers (ala XCOM) then you can safely get Wartales.", "label": 1}
