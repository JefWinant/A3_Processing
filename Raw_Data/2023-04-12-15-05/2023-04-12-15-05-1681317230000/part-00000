The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.\n\nThe soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.\n\nThe puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. \n\nThe stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.\n\nI played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.\n\nThe game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.\n\nThe game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.\nMost of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.\n\nCynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.\n\n\nWhat I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.\n\nThe final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.\nIt sadly felt a bit rushed.\n\n\n[h1]TLDR:[/h1]\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Charming artstyle and aesthetics\n    [*]Lovely OST\n    [*]Decently challenging puzzles\n    [*]Well paced gameplay\n    [*]Very basic character customization\n    [*]Collectibles offer replayability\n    [*]Comfortable time killer that could be finished in one sitting\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Minor bugs (Some already fixed, others can still be addressed)\n    [*]Different qualities between character models\n    [*]Underwhelming final Boss\n[/list]\n\n\nOverall I rate this game a 7.5/10\nIt could have been more, but it lived up to my expectations. \nI definitely had fun with it and I look forward to what Catthia Games will cook up in the future.", "label": 1}
