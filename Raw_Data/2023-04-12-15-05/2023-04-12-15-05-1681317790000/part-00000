I would say this game is slightly easier at the moment especially since BB has monsters that can woop you if you are not careful, developer seems to be trying to make game harder tough which sounds dope. I honestly don't have any bad things to say about the game so far its got a good combo going between the management and fighting aspects. 9/10 would buy again\n", "label": 1}
