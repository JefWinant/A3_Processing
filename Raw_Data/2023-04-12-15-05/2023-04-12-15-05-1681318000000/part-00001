I want to play to darn game but never really can because it is all about food and gold nothing else.  I understand that the gold/food is a core feature but dear lord dial it back a little bit.  I have all unlocks for gold reduction, food reduction, and repair reduction yet I ALWAYS run out of gold or food... I only have 4 companions and 2 beasts to try to keep the food consumption down but it is non-stop annoying that you are constantly running out of food, never have enough gold to buy anything from vendors really so only option is to steal and then you spend the time running from patrols.  As it sits only more hardcore players will ever play the game, dial it back slightly and you might get some additional players.", "label": 0}
