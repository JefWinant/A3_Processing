Has some pretty interesting elements, however being still in early access there isn't a great deal to do in the world. personally i think the battle caps can be a bit too big, it can be a real grind when youre fighting 20 wolves and you have 20 party members etc, these battles can take half an hour and happen quite frequently after a few hours gameplay. it also means there is no real attachment to any of the characters in your band and as such, whilst there are some good foundations laid the gameplay all ends up feeling rather insipid. dont pay more than 30 dollarydoos until some major updates happen.", "label": 0}
