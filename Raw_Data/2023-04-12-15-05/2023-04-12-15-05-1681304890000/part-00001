Now it`s on Steam with tons of content for new players (lucky guys) and what is more important - with new game mechanics, game modes and more. It`s not only free-to-play game, but it`s free indeed, you can play and grind, all operators can be purchased for in-game credits which are gained through playing (except the newest operators from the last battle pass, which is fine, as they become available for credits). The game process is fun, so cool to gather with friends and spend some time here. But you have to learn the mecanics, study base principles and operators perks. Glad that Caliber released on Steam to get new players and expand its community. Good luck to the team and players!", "label": 1}
