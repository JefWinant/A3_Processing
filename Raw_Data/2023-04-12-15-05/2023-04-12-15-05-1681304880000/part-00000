{"review_id": "136569128", "app_id": "307950", "review_text": "I'd rather play Warface then this. Horrible design Choices: 1. The Hud is a cluster fuck 2. You have a picture as a Scope (???) 3. Unlocking Operators takes forever 4. You respawn with the same amount of ammo you had before dying (???) 5. Ammo Boxes have a 5 minute cooldown 6. You only have 3 mags and it takes almost a full one to kill someone 7. You can only use your grenade/rpg once a match 8. Pretty much pay2win with the operators since you can just buy them, one has a one shot sniper 9. Horrible voice acting 10. You cant preview any Items 11. You can only pick 1 Item from a Lootbox and Finally 12. Bad Optimisation, i get more fps playing MW 2022.", "label": 0}
