The game is dynamic, has various game modes (with Frontline being my favorite) and has a great variety of operators. While being free, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win thing. I'm glad that it's finally on Steam so there's no need to use the separate launcher. All the best to the devs, you're going a great job!", "label": 1}
