{"review_id": "112776733", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "Could be an interesting game. Combat is fun and interesting.\n\nBut it's too frustrating to play until they improve the save game system. You can only have one save game per run and auto-saves are not reliable since there's no telling when it's being done. The ability to have more than one save per play-through as well as auto-saves for beginning of last combat and last entrance to town would be nice.\n\nUninstalling and will wait a year to see how it improves.\n\nEdit: Reinstalled to try the different save game setting called \"Free\" and is a lot more helpful than the default setting. Would be nice to have a Quick Save option with the \"Free save\" option like many other games that gives the save game names by the relative position in the world or something.", "label": 1}
