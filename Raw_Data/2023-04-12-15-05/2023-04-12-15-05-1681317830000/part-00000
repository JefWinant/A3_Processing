Many types of mission/quest that does not repetitive much. Good graphics although I hope there would be more kill animation. \n\nMultiple hours of fun. However, the game is too quiet for my taste, no voice acting, but not a big deal. Limited character customization but armors and weapons are design beautifully which is fun.\n\nThis game have the potential to expand into and epic game.\n\nOverall :  8.1\nGraphics : 8.0\nStory : 7.0\nCombat : 9.0\nSurvival : 8.5\nReplayability : 8.0\n", "label": 1}
