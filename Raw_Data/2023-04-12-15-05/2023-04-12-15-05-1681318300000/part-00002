{"review_id": "109836280", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  \n\n42hrs in the first area alone.  \nI felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.\n\nAs ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like \"Wartales\" feels like a \"Play the way you want to with the backstory you want\" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.\n\nOh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.\n\nAfter all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.\n\nOverall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..\n\nI don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a \"MEH\" for now.\nMaybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?\n\n\n", "label": 1}
