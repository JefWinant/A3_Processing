Since then, I haven't found a turn-based RPG that I enjoyed until I discovered Wartales a few months ago through YouTube videos. It's a fantastic modern successor to the Turn based RPG games from my childhood, and I absolutely love it.\n\nThe developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat. Playing in open GL mode reduces the problem, but I hope the developers add the Nvidia optimization to solve this issue.\n\nDespite this issue, I highly recommend this game at its full price, and it's worth every penny. Don't wait for a sale; get it now.", "label": 1}
