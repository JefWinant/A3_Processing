I found myself sinking more than 110 hours into it without even noticing how much time had passed. One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.\n\nAnother standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.\n\nOverall, Wartales is a fantastic game that offers a rich and satisfying experience. Its unique features and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of strategy and RPG games.", "label": 1}
