{"review_id": "136574310", "app_id": "1919720", "review_text": "The game released in a promising state on Early Access: The foundation was there, the gameplay loop was fun, decent spells and even if it was lacking in both content and mechanics at the time, the hints of what was upcoming was promising and would have very likely made it a great game in the genre. I don't know what happened but unfortunately the game barely received any updates during the Early access period and was left in an incomplete state that just make it hard to recommend to anyone. The Early Access tag was simply removed during release day without any content update, which means that the devs were unable to continue working on the game for any reason.\n\nI'm deeply disappointed because from all the games in the genre this was the one that perhaps I was the most excited about because I really liked the overall setting and base spells but if you are looking for a game of this type my suggestion is to play something else.", "label": 0}
