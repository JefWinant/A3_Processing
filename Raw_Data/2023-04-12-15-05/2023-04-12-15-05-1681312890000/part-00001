It's great to come home from work and relax to nice music. Loved the art with the cat girls. The only thing they lack is animation, hopefully the developers will fix that. \nThe well thought out story and interaction with the characters drew me into this game. I was surprised that such a simple looking game had multiple endings to choose from. This gave me the incentive to explore other story options. If you love puzzles, kittens, and all things cute, this game is definitely for you! \ud83d\ude3b", "label": 1}
