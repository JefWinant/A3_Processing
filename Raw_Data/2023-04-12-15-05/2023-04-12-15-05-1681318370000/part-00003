{"review_id": "107184003", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "THIS GAME IS SO GOOD SO FAR. Great squad mechanics and though the combat does feel grueling at some points its never 'annoyingly slow' (might b nice to have the option to skip enemy combat animations and/or allied ones). Trade system is good, the difficulty of enemies with leveling is nice as I've had companions die but it has been nowhere near a common occurence (on Normal difficulty). Quests are fun, storylines are exciting, I'm vaguely addicted to how fun this game has been and... -- I'm excited to see all this game can/will hold", "label": 1}
