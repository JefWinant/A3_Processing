It does very well to quickly get you into the game, and everything is easy to understand and play. No convolution what-so-ever. Cute art style, good music, good effects and animations.\n\nGameplay-wise, you pick your \"hero\" card, and go on a randomly generated, mostly-linear journey and get as far as you can. Once you die, you pick a new hero and do it all over again while upgrading your town over time to provide you with new cards, items, etc.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of deck-builders or card games, but this one is definitely worth looking at and considering as it is actually a lot of fun.", "label": 1}
