So much to do with so many combinations to play with. I've only played being a noble group of mercenaries, doing contracts etc, everything from killing bandits to finding items and it can be totally unforgiving if your not careful. You have the option to play it safe or get stuck in to the heavy opponents, just make sure your geared for it haha. It's also clear that you can choose to be a sneaky group of bandits a pray on unsuspecting caravans etc. Love it. Well done.\nCan't wait to see what content you bring out for this.", "label": 1}
