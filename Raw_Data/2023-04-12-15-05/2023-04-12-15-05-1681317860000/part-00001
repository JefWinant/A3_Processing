{"review_id": "133315877", "app_id": "1527950", "review_text": "A fantastic game even in Early Access.\nPlenty of content to keep you engaged, with over 100 locations to discover and more coming when V1.0 arrives. There's a little arena, tons of quests, little 'bosses' you can fight that once killed, drops unique and upgradable weapons, Bounties to fulfil, relationships between your companions, even arguments. \nCo-op is also an option if you're into that.\nThe game keeps getting better and better every single update and it keeps me coming back to it.\nThe only negative thing I can actually say about it is the fact that I can't decapitate people. Why am I allowed to whip my little slave men but I can't execute them.\n\nAn absolutely fantastic game overall and I recommend it for people who enjoy tactical, turn-based RPGs.", "label": 1}
