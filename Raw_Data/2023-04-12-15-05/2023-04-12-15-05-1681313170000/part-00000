It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. \n\nOn the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.\n\nSpecial shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.\n\nVery excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game.", "label": 1}
