{"review_id": "136569414", "app_id": "1772830", "review_text": "TLDR: I highly recommend Rusted Moss.\n\n************************************\n\nI was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.\n\nRusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or \"breaking\" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.\n\nThe gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.\n\nThe story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.\n\nIf you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who \u2018click\u2019 with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting.", "label": 1}
