It looks like a poorer copy of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Phantoms. \n\nThe feel of the weapons is bad. The camera being rigidly attached to the character doesn't help. Just tweak the camera to make the gameplay more fluid and enjoyable. \n\nGraphics are ok, nothing major.\n\nThe game has potential.", "label": 0}
