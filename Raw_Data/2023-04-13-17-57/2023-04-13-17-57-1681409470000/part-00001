{"review_id": "136634405", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Good game with similar beats from Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Darkest Dungeon. 10/10 art and clear interface.\n\nI beat the final (final) boss and I can see why people are complaining about the game being difficult, but that's what makes good roguelike games. It would not be fun if you could just brainlessly steamroll everything. My advice to new players is if they are familiar with other deckbuilders, the key is to make your deck concise so when you redraw, you get the same set of tools. You will just need to know what can handle what scenarios. The difficulty really is just a learning curve like all roguelikes. \n\nAlso a UX suggestion for the devs: add death previews when it's obvious. For example if an item is obviously going to kill an enemy, have an X show up or something. Conversely, when an ally is obviously going to die at the end of the turn at a position, make it highlight red or something. With the number of things happening in this game, sometimes players can miss the obvious (I certainly have o-o) and this will make the game possibly feel easier.\n\nOverall I look forward to trying new builds and would recommend this game to anyone who really wants a brain tickler.", "label": 1}
