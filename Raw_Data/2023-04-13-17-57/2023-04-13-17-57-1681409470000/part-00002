{"review_id": "136634077", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Since reviews for Wildfrost (at the time of release) are so polarized, i figured i'd share my own early impressions.\n\nI really enjoy the core gameplay, you and your enemy's cards being on two separate lanes leads to tough decision-making situations and the cards you find throughout your run can have neat interactions with one another thanks to interesting but simple to understand keywords and card effects.\nWildfrost feels hard but rarely in a mean way, some runs do end prematurely but i feel like that's just the game punishing misplays (perhaps too harshly for some).\n\nI'm obviously not far enough into the game to comment on how balanced it actually is, so i'll just say that the difficulty hasn't really lead to any strong frustration for me so far.  If you've played card battlers like this before and don't mind being slapped around a bit when you first get into a game, i recommend Wildfrost ! \n\nIf you're more of a casual enjoyer or the idea of doing ascensions in Slay the Spire repulses you, you should probably wait until some balance patches and maybe even difficulty options are introduced before you make the jump.", "label": 1}
