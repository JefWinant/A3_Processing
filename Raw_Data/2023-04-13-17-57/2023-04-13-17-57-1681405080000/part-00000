{"review_id": "136632296", "app_id": "1694740", "review_text": "I hate to have to give this a negative review, but the controls are not proper in my opinion. Instead of thrust, WASD allows you to \"dodge\". Oddly, you have to hold down shift in order to thrust. This was unwieldy, so I changed thrust to W and just let that evasion direction go. But without reverse thrust, it's still too difficult to properly maneuver. I'm far from bad at video games, but with this kind of control scheme, I found it fairly impossible to beat even the second stage boss.\n\nMaybe the controls are such that you're meant to use the dodge buttons exclusively in combat, but the game doesn't make this clear and I'm not sure if that would work better. And also, that's not really how \"dodge\" is supposed to be used.\n\nThat being said, I do like the other aspects. I like how the mining probes work, and the mechanics to force you to leave a sector after a certain time. I like the upgrade system too.\n\nThat being said, without a revamp of the control scheme, I can't recommend this game.", "label": 0}
