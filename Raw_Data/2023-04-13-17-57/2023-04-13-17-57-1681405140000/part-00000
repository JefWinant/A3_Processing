{"review_id": "136633035", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Don't normally review games, but the reviews have kind of done this one dirty, so I'm dropping this in case the \"Mixed\" (at the time of writing) turns someone off.\n\nThis game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.\n\nNegative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the \"balancing\"). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.\n\nThe art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update. Check the game out if this sounds interesting to you!", "label": 1}
