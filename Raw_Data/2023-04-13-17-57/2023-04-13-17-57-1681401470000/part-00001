{"review_id": "136628857", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Heavily unbalanced, the game ramps up WAY too fast to be fair, most of the time I die its from a sudden surge that I literally couldnt do anything about, the leaders are WAY too flimsy when them dying causes instant loss. The challenge isnt from skill, its almost purely luck based, if i try to go for any build it gets fucked by the very next draw, it doesnt allow you to build any specific deck and you dont get enough heroes to not have to worry about all your heroes being at 1 hp, most runs if I get to a boss I end up with like 4 playable characters that cant take many hits. Hell the characters MADE to take hits cant take hits as any healing is EXTREMELY rare or has an insanely high wind up, even the first battle is insanely unbalanced, expecting you to kill mountains of enemies that buff from you killing enemies or those enemies attacking, that its just completely illogical, this game needs SERIOUS fixes in its battle progression.\n\nI recommend starting with a battle thats not a million enemies constantly buffing eachother to the point that they all OHKO the card that instantly loses your game.\n\nI saw RT play this and it looked like a lot of fun, I love roguelike deck builders but this, this just feels like a mess of horrible balancing and crappy difficulty spikes.\n\nThe first 2 runs wont be too bad, but after that regardless of who you pick the difficulty ramp will be too high.\n\nIll keep my finger on the pulse of this game, watching for updates as I really want this game to be good, I want to enjoy this, but thats not something I can do with where its at now.", "label": 0}
