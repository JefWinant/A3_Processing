{"review_id": "136629200", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Everything about this game is well done, except the deckbuilding and the combat...; the two parts of the game that are the actual meat in this genre.\n\nAction economy is everything: one card = one turn. Each turn, every character on the field ticks down by 1 - and when they hit 0, they activate and do their thing. Additionally, enemies attack first, so even if your units have the same timer, they can very likely perish.\n\nThis means three things:\n(1) Companions are better cards to than most of the effect cards, because they'll activate repeatedly AND be removed from your deck AND can tank hits for you/leader.\n(2) Crowns [80g item] are the best item in the shop, and the one you should make sure you can always buy. A Crown on a card means that it can be played at the start of the game for free - giving you an extra minion on the board, casting a spell for free, etc; it's a 100% draw+play at no cost (minus the one-time 80g cost).\n(3) The fact that your minions get weaker for the next combat after they die is ATROCIOUS. While I said companions are generally better cards to play - this is due to their stats:activation time ratio - something that is significantly weakened should they die in a fight; and makes them detrimental cards to play (since your 1 turn playing can = 6 enemy turns ticking down). If you play a minion with the same turn timer as the enemy - it's going to get hit first, and likely die - moreso if it's still injured from the prior battle.\n\nThis isn't a puzzle game, it's a punishment game. \n\nFrankly, there's a lot of times where there's straight up nothing you can do to play around the enemy/board state - and on top of that, each battles designs/mechanics are extremely polarized - you either might be able to deal with it (if lucky opener+having the cards in your deck at all), or you simply cant [and there's no way to determine ahead of time what a fight might be].\n\nHonestly, this game tries to copy Quantum Protocol's gameplay, but without the designs/mechanics that actually let you get ahead on the board; despite 1 card = 1 turn for the field. If the combat is the part of the game you like most about this game, you'd do well to at least check that game out, as it's a deckbuiler-puzzle game as well (don't forget as long as it's been less than 2h playtime+2weeks owned, Steam will allow you to automatically refund a game).", "label": 0}
