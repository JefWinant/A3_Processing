{"review_id": "136629183", "app_id": "2328760", "review_text": "Amazing lighting with HDR and Raytracing and most tables just look better all around. The only legal place to play classic Williams recreations like Twilight Zone, Swords of Fury, etc. It's only gonna get better. Trust me, we have come a lonnnnnnng way from over a year ago when the game hit early access. We now have proper portrait mode and all new tables will only be available in the new platform and not FX3. \n\nNegative reviews are from haters who want free table upgrades when this is not a simple port job. Everything had to be built in a brand new engine (Unreal) and it took a lot of man-hours. Further, Zen announced that old tables would not be free upgrades literally two years ago and have never changed their stance on that. Zen actually communicated this very clearly many times, but I guess not everyone got the message. Devs have to eat, too.\n\nYes, there are inconsistencies in that some Williams tables like Black Rose have a highly spammable center broadside shot (not present in FX3 where it is a lot harder to hit) and many Williams tables play easier than they did in FX3 (and I would argue easier than real life as well). There are exceptions though, Space Station is still hard as is Dr. Dude and Whitewater. \n\nWe still need custom cameras and multiplayer Battle Royale mode added as promised and we need VR (due to come out this year) but we are well on our way folks. Ignore the haters and grab this game! And hey, you have three free-to-play tables including Fish Tales, so what have you got to lose? Free one day Pinball Pass as well so you can play everything and see what is worth it to you. Another hit against the haters!", "label": 1}
