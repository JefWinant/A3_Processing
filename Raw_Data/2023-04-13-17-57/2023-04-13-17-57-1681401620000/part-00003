ITS TOO GOOD \n\nOne of the Best Action RPGs of 2023 so far in my opinion and I play Indie Games for Living \n\nAmazing Story 10/10 Very Solid , Reminds me of the movie Priest \n\nAn Open World Esque system, where you have to explore the world to unlock new areas \n\nLots of Save points everywhere and you can save there as many times as you like\n\nEnemies respawn if you leave and area and comeback \n\nA whole plethora of unique weapons, Armour, Dark Spells , and Totems to find in the world\n\nVery Balanced Game world, its feels perfect \n\nAmazing boss fights \n\nYou can take various contracts to hunt specific monster , once you kill them you can collect the bounty or reward \n\n\nRATING - 10/10\n( PERFECT - JUST BUY IT )", "label": 1}
