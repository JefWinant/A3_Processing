But thats just my personal preference, You play what you want to play!\n\nRight now it seems like quite an okey game, Gunplay is nice. Not to fast and not to slow in terms of progression, So far there is plenty of incentives for players to jump in and earn. And with the steam event currently going on you can get 400 premium currency each day just by winning 5 games. and there is 6 days remaining. However with that out of the way i would like to bring up some concerning points about the game\n\nFor starters:\n[b][u][i]The Bad[/i][/u][/b]\n- Premium skins for operators seem to cost just a bit to much. at $16 all you get for your legendary skin is a 25% bonus to XP.\n- Insane pricing for HQ Backgrounds. Thats right for $15 you can get a pretty little rare HQ background called mountain pass that all it serves to do is just make the background look cooler.\n- Operator investments gets more and more insane in terms of credit cost.\n- Not Everything is initially available to the player and must progress account levels in order to unlock AKA, Daily objectives @ lvl 3, New game modes at 8 & 10, Weeklies @ 12 etc etc\n- Premium currency conversion is a joke, 1000 coins converts to 22k credits. which is like 1-2 upgrades depending on the operators level\n- Limited & Restricted selection of customisation via normal progression. Meaning a camo / emotes or takedown animations you unlocked for said operator only works for said operators team AKA... KSK, Seals, Grom, CST etc etc. if you unlock a camo for KSK you cant use it for other operators youve unlocked in other teams so you need to re-unlock it which is absolutely stupid.\n- Onslaught game mode is honestly a joke and not even remotely difficult\n\n[b][u][i]The Good[/i][/u][/b]\n- Gunplay is well rounded\n- Can be a heavily focused team based game, played against teams that are greatly coordinated and preform their operators duties well\n- Amount of diverse and engaging game modes.\n- Somewhat evenly balanced maps, Mostly due to just being symmetrical.\n- Acceptable Initial Boost to new players progression, you will be earning alot of credits and coins if you played right now, But for those that join a bit to late you will still earn a great amount of credits\n- All operators available for credits & the store will cycle discounts for purchasing operators with credits.\n- Receiving duplicate rewards via RNG loot boxes will provide fragments that you are able to use on a limited selection of cosmetics for your account etc, Would be great if this was expanded upon to other cosmetic aspects.\n\nTL;DR\nThere is good aspects about the game but there is not particularly good that stands out for the game to shine. it lacks in alot of areas but provides a good enough gunplay and gameplay experience that you can play for an hour and be modestly satisfied. The only reason why i recommend it right now is simply because the steam event is to good of an event to pass up and unlike other games grinding such events becomes tedious but winning 5 games takes no time at all. just play against bots!\n\n5.5/10", "label": 1}
