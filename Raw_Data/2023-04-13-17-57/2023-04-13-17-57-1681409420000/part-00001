I know Ultrakill is something I immediately hopped on after playing the demo, where I might've waited a bit longer after it got more hyped up to get it, but I think if you like what you see with the Rusted Moss gameplay, you'll probably have fun if you can clear the difficulty floor of the bungee.", "label": 1}
