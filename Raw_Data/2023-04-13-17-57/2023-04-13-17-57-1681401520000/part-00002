As of their current Steam release, the newbie welfare tasks and rewards are pretty decent, though how free currency will be gained further down the line is still up to speculation. \n\nGameplay wise, animations might seem a bit stiff, but overall still quite immersive. The russian voiceovers are also a bit more emotive than the english ones. Decent replay value, though one problem is when I have to go AFK due to external circumstances, the game will impose an increasing increment of a time limit that restricts you from playing that game mode each time you go AFK; hopefully they'll address that because some players aren't trying to ghost teammates but are simply forced to leave due to real-life obligations, though of course I understand solutions to such issues are easier said than done.\n\nGame modes are pretty interesting, consisting of a variety falling under the main categories of PvE, PvP, and a combination of both, which is PvPvE. There's mini storylines and cutscenes for each mission to introduce the setting. \n\n(As someone who is more of a TPS than an FPS enjoyer (even though I am fine with playing both), because I like being able to see my character in combat, and not just their hands and legs. Its a decent addition to TPS games out there (and its free too), given how FPS games have vastly saturated the market in comparison. I never really thought about the TPS corner peeking argument or whatever because when you play TPS as a whole you don't really care about that since its not that big of an edge, just a different form of gameplay.)", "label": 1}
