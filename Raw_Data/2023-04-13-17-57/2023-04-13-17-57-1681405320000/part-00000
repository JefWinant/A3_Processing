The game's graphics are nice, but that's about it with this game, the atmosphere is really lacking something to make it scarier and more immersive. Its gameplay is not that fun either because you only have to go from room to room to find the key for the next room (I think I've used the camera or something other than the keys to open one door but the game does not tell you much so I don't know exactly what I did lol). There is only 1 enemy in this game and it seems that it does not follow you everywhere (just on the floor you spawn) and when it catches you, you take damage from him but he does not move at all while attacking you lol. This game really does need some work but it is really cheap and for just 1$ you can support an indie dev and his work.\n", "label": 1}
