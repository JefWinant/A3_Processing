I did the same thing in C1, so this is very much a \u201cme\u201d problem and not an issue with the game!\n\nThere is a singular overarching main case - the story is relatively linear, with side quests throughout.  If you have a side quest in the chapter, complete it there and then \u2013 once you leave an area you can\u2019t go back later to finish off.  I\u2019ll be going back and replaying the first chapter for that reason \u2013 it\u2019s not like C1 where you have free reign to go back on yourself.\n\nThere was only one thing I found annoying at times \u2013 Watson! He kept following me and then trapping me in a room and taking ages to step out the way.  I did have a glitch in the game where Watson was managing to row a boat while hovering in the air alongside it\u2026silly Watson!\n\nThe voice acting is on point and the music and produced very atmospheric scenes.  The game is graphically stunning and leans heavily into Lovecraft, which separates it from C1 entirely.  In terms of game play time, it\u2019s a touch shorter than I would have liked, much shorter than C1.  I\u2019ve seen some completing it in approx. 6 hours, but for me, I\u2019ve finished on 17 hours \u2013 I like to spend time exploring and collecting all there is to collect, racing through isn\u2019t enjoyable for me.\n\nI cannot leave this review without mentioning the beautifully interwoven patriotic shades of yellow and blue.  Such delicately placed nods to solidarity brought a smile to my face, and the team are to be applauded for their resilience in the face of adversity \u2013 slava Ukraini.\n\nOverall rating 8/10", "label": 1}
