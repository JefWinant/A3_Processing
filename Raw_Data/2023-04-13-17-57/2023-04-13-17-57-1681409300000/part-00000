It's a small developing team not a Triple A title, there are going to be bugs. \nIf you want a near perfect game go buy a $70 title at GameStop not a $12 game on Steam.\nThe bugs are minor, the development team is releasing patches and fixing them as they are found so that isn't the issue.\n\nThe game is fun if you like games like Gold Miner or Out of Ore where you are performing mindless repetitive tasks like removing dirt and selling it to buy new equipment.\nThe problem is the actual mining takes little to no effort so it is incredibly easy to buy everything the game has to offer in one play session leaving you virtually nothing to do after.\n\nI can only hope the dev team has much more in store for DLC to increase replay value. There in game store contained a train in the demo that is not there in the finished game so there's hope they have more in store.", "label": 1}
