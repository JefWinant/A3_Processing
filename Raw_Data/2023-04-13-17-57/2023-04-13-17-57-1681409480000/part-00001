{"review_id": "136633287", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "This game is extremely difficult, but not due to good mechanics or an ounce of balancing. This game is purposefully made difficult by severely nerfing the player's chances, and RNG are a joke. The scaling is abhorrently unbalanced, where the player has very little control over how their deck is built or how to synergize anything, since all your loot and cards and companions are RNG without any option to re-roll or decline a card option. \n\nOverall, while it is cute and has some fresh concept, it is poorly implemented where the only way they could make the game challenging is to make the player weak.", "label": 0}
