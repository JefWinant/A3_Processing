I've only played for 14 minutes so far but I am already in love with it !! I love that they kept a lot of the charming artwork and layout of the first game, so right away it feels comfortable and familiar. \n\nAlso I discovered the existence of the tiny tiny birds and I screamed. Everything is so so cute and fun and I just feel so happy while playing this game. The devs really created such a lovely game with such cute artwork! I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the music/artwork of games like Animal Crossing, Terraria, or older SNES games like Kirby Superstar. The gameplay is very satisfying, so if you like idle games, you should definitely give this a shot! :o)", "label": 1}
