The developers have put so much into this game, from the small engaging mini games, to the detail in each game system, whilst not too complex, providing that level of depth to keep you engaged as you go throughout your journey in the world.\n\nThe world itself is relatively alive and you can be ambushed, attack other parties and so on, engage in conversation and events with persons and merchants and so on.\n\nThe combat is easy enough to adapt to if it is  not your go to and provides a degree of entertainment beyond a simple turn based game. With inclusion of cinematic cutscenes every now and then and the gore and so on. Combat is satisfying and the shear volume of makeup and parties you can have from mercenaries and animals alike leaves you with plenty of choice.\n\nThe game mechanics are sound, criminal systems, repercussions for your actions in the world and a reputation based system that forms over time in the form of paths and knowledge. \n\nOverall supported from early days of development and by far one of the best EA titles I have supported to date and they deserved every penny. Will definitely be supporting Shrio Games in the future and hope they have many successful projects to come!", "label": 1}
