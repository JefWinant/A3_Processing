I do get why it's getting a mixed score. Usually, I don't write reviews but for card games in particular I feel like I have enough experience to properly rate them somewhat.\n\nDo I think the game is a horrible mess? No. Do I think it's as good as the genre mainstays like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, also No but it can be. It has some AMAZING qualities, the art style of course, the faster-paced gameplay, and I really like the combat that puts so much emphasis on the countdown mechanics etc. However as many have stated the game is wildly unbalanced or at least unbalanced enough that it feels like it's impossible to have good runs. I definitely feel like this issue can be fixed, I am not a developer so I can't say how, but I know it's possible! And I still have hope for this game\n\nThe developers have made an amazing game and I really hope they take in the good that they've made here, this is a strong foundation. The clock that you use to refill your hand is such a neat mechanic. Injuries make you feel like you're a team rather than a deck of cards. This game doesn't just present a game like Slay the spire it presents a world silly as it might be.\n\nIf the release is the end of the road for this game, then I am happy enough with the product even if I don't recommend it. However, if this game gets a balance update and maybe just a few updates I think this can be a gem! \n", "label": 0}
