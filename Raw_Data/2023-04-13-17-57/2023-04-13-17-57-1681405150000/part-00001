{"review_id": "136632091", "app_id": "1811990", "review_text": "Wildforst seems like an exciting take on the card battling genre at first. However, there are a few issues that I have with the mechanics/descriptions that the game fails to inform you of correctly.\n\nFirstly, I was under the impression that aimless meant the enemy or ally could even hit someone that was on their team, this does not seam to be true and honestly I prefer it that way but the wording for the description of aimless makes it unclear.\n\nSecondly, and this is why I believe I need to rate the game poorly, mechanics such as soulbound skulls do not work as described. It and items similar to it specifically state that it targets a random ally. In my best run (thank the RNG gods) I used the item and it soulbound my leader which meant that I could not kill the enemy I needed to or I would die... The enemy I soulbound was the boss soooo that did not work out for me.\n\nMy third major issue is in reference to me thanking the RNG gods because like many have previously stated the difficulty spike in this game is insane. I've played games like Slay the Spire, One Step From Eden, Ring of Pain, Darkest Dungeon, and Inscryption yet this somehow feels much greater in difficulty and what many people are calling out as only a few viable builds are correct.\n\nI desperately want the developers to fix these issues and I know the game was only recently released, but these are my issues and I hope the feedback pushes the ball forward in terms of Wildfrost being improved.", "label": 0}
