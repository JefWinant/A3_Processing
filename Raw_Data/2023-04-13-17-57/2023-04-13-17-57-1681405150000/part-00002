I would wait for this to be on sale for at least half off or for them to add more content, quality of life and balance updates.  \n\nPros\nThe animations and city building aspect are great.  Randomized heroes are fun.   \n\nCons\nThe not being able to pass on a card mechanic is tiresome. \nThe balance is, as others have said, a little out of whack.\nIt's very tedious and grindy after a few runs, and not in a fun way like Slay the Spire.\nThe insane amount of passives the enemies have vs what you can actually get.\nThere doesn't seem to be a wide variety of cards to chose from.  \n", "label": 0}
