I loved every bit of it!\nI'm not good at reviewing games, so I'll keep it simple:\n\nPROS\n+ unique mechanic of a shrinking island\n+ nice graphics (although maybe not everyone's cup of tea)\n+ good value for money (story mode + skirmish + endless)\n+ addictive gameplay\n+ clear tutorial\n\nCONS\n- sometimes it may be difficult to tell some buildings apart (especially when they're the same type, next to each other, but on different levels)\n- sometimes ships don't move the way you'd expect them to\n\nOverall, it's a solid indie game that delivers its premise and, despite minor flaws, is really fun to play.", "label": 1}
