(in the end they are two sides of the same coin, needless to deny)\n\nAfter years of development I definitely expected a more advanced stage and a more defined product and less biased stuff: most of the operators are Russians, the name of the Discord is written in Cyrillic as well as most of the Discord channels, the English section is relegated to two measly channels and so on.\nI will update the review (for better or for worse) as soon as I have a more complete opinion.\n\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list][*]The graphic is nice, unfortunately you cannot change the brightness from the settings so some scenery comes out far too bright for my taste but all in all it is enjoyable and the maps, at least as far as PvE is concerned, are enjoyable and varied. \n\n[*]Most of the animations are done well, I appreciated the fact that the developers decided to take a more tactical, slow-paced approach than most of the games coming out lately where you end up with monkeys jumping left and right. \n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list][*]TTK is too high.\nBelieve me, I'm the first to hate games where you die with very few shots and I would abolish all the weapons that bodyshot but in this case I found myself in serious trouble.\nBots and players are bullet sponges, only headshots seem to do fair damage but hitreg and netcode doesn't work as it should, which is one of the many reasons I'm avoiding PvP.\nI also find it absurd that in first person the scope is off center on most weapons.\n\n[*]An excessive grinding (it's still a free to play title, if you want to get things in human times without having to nerd out you have to pay, there is little to do about it) combined with few things to do and a very high cost of the operators present in the game (both with game coins and real money) is the perfect matching to bore you after a few hours, even Caliber's Twitch drops are a grind...\nAnd in true Wargaming's style there is the possibility to convert real money into game currency in order to have almost everything immediately, in some ways it feels more like a mobile game.\n[/list]\n\n[u]My components:[/u]\nRTX 3060TI 8GB\nI5-9600K 3.70Ghz\n16 GB RAM DDR4 3000mhz", "label": 0}
