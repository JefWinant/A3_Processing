Get one day of pinball Pass for free and play 70% of the tables right now.\n\nI DID NOT play the 3DS zen pinball game but wen I was a kid I played a little game called \"Big Race USA\" which took my understanding and love for pinball to the next level.\n\nI want to talk about the history I have with the Pinball FX  franchise.  There's a ton of love but also some painful things.\n\nXBOX LIVE ARCADE.  Xbox 360 i was introduced to Pinball FX.  Okay, it ran at a terrible 60FPS but it was almost the definitive version.  It had local SPLIT SCREEN.  it had 4-player Online Multiplayer with our avatars in the 4 corners.  I owned all of the tables.\n\nWelp, i NEVER owned an Xbox One and never played Pinball FX2 on an XBONE so that means I LOSE ALL MY TABLES.\n\nBut that's okay because Pinball FX2 VR comes out and now I can put my face INSIDE of the table.\nThey added a few DLCs.  Def not enough.  (Balls of Steel in VR would've been appreciated.  idk.)\n\nNow I've been buying tables on Steam anytime there's a sale.  I own a decent amount.\nIt's like rebuilding my old library.  And Now it seems like I don't own any again.\n\nApparently I own \"Heavy Hitters\" on Pinball FX3.  A $10 pack of tables.  (probably got it on sale.)\nBut it says I can complete the pack for $5 (50% off).  So if you buy Pinball FX tables you get the Pinball FX3 table with it.\nWho's going back to Pinball FX3?  I guess Me cuz why do we pay $5 for raytracing? \n\nI actually own one month of Pinball Pass on my Xbox Series X and playing it on there a little.  And that seems like the route to go.\n\nI will prob buy the new tables on here tho.  I like the Godzilla one!", "label": 1}
