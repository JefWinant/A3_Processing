The game is really cheap and offers about half an hour of gameplay in which you can finish the game 2 times to get the both endings. You really won't do much in the game, just walk to find Easter eggs to be able to pass the area. It has some jumpscares, weird sounds, the graphics are old school and the story is a short Easter themed one.", "label": 1}
