{"review_id": "136634346", "app_id": "1649740", "review_text": "Absolutely rock solid. A top down action game with strong combat, something akin to Bloodborne, though with shooting almost like a twin stick shooter, albeit a bit more deliberate. It's fast, precise, pretty tough, but fair. You have to juggle multiple types of attacks which flow together nicely, making encounters almost puzzle-like as you figure out the best strategy and maximize the use of your resources. The aesthetic is quite strong as well, with stellar art direction. I confess that I'm finding the narrative a bit abstruse at the moment, but that might clear up with time. The important part is that it has enough intrigue to pull me along, and a powerful core combat element that makes it worth exploring. A definite recommend!", "label": 1}
