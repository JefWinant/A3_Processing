I was a bit worried after reading some negative reviews, but I bit the bullet and bought it, and the game is fantastic. I'm unsure where people are having issues with winning, as the game feels perfectly challenging. You can't play this game by just hoping you're so powerful it's brain dead, there is more thought that gets put into each battle. Definitely give it try if you're on the fence.", "label": 1}
