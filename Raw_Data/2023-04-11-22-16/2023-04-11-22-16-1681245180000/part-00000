Here would be my comments for further improvements from the devs:\n- Include a FPS limit (it was running at >300 FPS and my ventilators started to go hard)\n- The lava should not move up at the start in order to give the player more time to learn and get used to the controls\n- Platforms at the beginning should be larger, and can grow smaller the further the player goes", "label": 1}
