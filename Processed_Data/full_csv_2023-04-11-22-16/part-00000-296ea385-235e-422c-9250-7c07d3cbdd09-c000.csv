1949030,1,136536061,After playing the demo and completing the first case from the full game I'm absolutely in love with it. Beautifully detailed and runs very well on my mid-range laptop.
1949030,1,136535945,❤️
1949030,1,136534363,"As with other Sherlock Holmes games by Frogwares, I was really please about the atmosphere, story and overal Holmes topics. This one seems far more than a remake/revamp of the previous Awakened game and I am looking forward to the next chapters of the game."
2348920,1,136538038,"TBH, I played this game for 4 hours straight and still couldnt finish the first level. I couldnt experience any bugs so far, seems like I'm just a bad player in those kind of games."
2189970,1,136538016,"Awesome game! There's a lot to learn, so definitely go through the tutorial."
2207970,1,136538116,it's soooo good omg yes sooooo good yes yes yes soooo good
2248580,1,136536204,"This is a very beautiful casual game in the genre of three in a row, in which we will meet 5 charming cat girls. The toy will delight you with a significant number of levels, animated screensavers with girls, pleasant music and relaxing gameplay. Pleased with the availability of achievements and reasonable price."
2312110,1,136536305,I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. Was fun though
2349550,1,136536235,"Secret Word - VictoriousThis one hit a little too close to home, Love this series and many more games to come!"
2349550,1,136536005,Strength..... it is then.
1685730,1,136538317,She's just like me fr

2355710,1,136538751,"It'a great game for a first game, although I would have liked more songs the game is basically like a book. It's short sweet, it has a very philosophical story it's very relatable it delves into deep ideas. Also I would have liked if it was longer and if it had more places. 7,3/10"
1409300,1,136536272,"Wow! Saya benar-benar terkesan dengan game Rendezvouz. Tidak hanya gameplay-nya yang mengasyikkan, tetapi dunia dalam game ini sungguh memukau. Setiap level penuh dengan detail yang luar biasa, dan lingkungannya begitu hidup sehingga saya seringkali terdiam sejenak untuk menikmati pemandangan di sekitar saya. Para pengembang game benar-benar berhasil menciptakan dunia yang indah dan mengesankan. Jika Anda mencari game dengan grafis yang memukau dan gameplay yang mengasyikkan, Rendezvouz adalah jawabannya. Saya sangat merekomendasikan game ini untuk semua orang!"
2372620,1,136536380,"The game is simple but can become very addictive. Here would be my comments for further improvements from the devs:- Include a FPS limit (it was running at >300 FPS and my ventilators started to go hard)- The lava should not move up at the start in order to give the player more time to learn and get used to the controls- Platforms at the beginning should be larger, and can grow smaller the further the player goes"
2008820,1,136539241,this game can really help you with depressionyes it will make you more depressed
2008820,1,136538702,my favourite part was when the knight started mourning
2008820,1,136538678,Really good while being so sick that I just shake like I have epilepsy. (8*4)/(16*2).Tbh I will play the game again after I get better.
2008820,1,136537722,"frank frank frank frank frank frank frank frank frank frank frank frankbeautiful game, no bugs whatsoever"
2008820,1,136536737,gave me carpal tunnel
2008820,1,136536397,"i loved this game, the level editor is quite nice and the workshop is already growing fast so if you get tired of the pain caused by the base game, you can just hop on over and make some stuff"
2008820,1,136536697,"great game it took me a while to beat, (i havent seen grass since i started playing, hes holding me hostage)"
2008820,1,136536732,"I LOVED IT, when the knight said, \"It's mourning time\". And then the funeral started, and we all cried."
1118110,1,136538798,"Game runs fine, no fps drops or anything, has built in reset in case vehicle or player gets stuck (only happened once, flipped an excavator somehow) mission is straight forward. Only complaint is tutorial needs work, it runs a basic video of how a machine works and you get no more after purchasing last vehicle and leaves out important worker system"
2008820,1,136536053,"Very cool game, there are knights, would reccomend!"
1949030,1,136537655,"The very first side case was already chilling. And a little sad. Perfectly set in the grim darkness of ....Victorian London. Well, I played the original as well a good while ago and I must say I am already hooked with the new interpretation. This already feels like another masterpiece by Frogwares."
2318550,1,136538045,"The game is great, nice drawn graphics, not pixel, which is already boring, and the music is of course chic."
2166050,1,136538785,you get to play as a moon! no game has made me feel more like a moon.
2109430,1,136538037,"-The game was super short-The dialogue was well written, and I liked the choice mechanic and how it affected the story-The background lore and story were alright, but the lore was insufficient I think, and a bit confusing-The music and art were great-The minigame was boring-It still felt like a Tron game though7/10"
2318550,1,136537971,Deathly Dangerous is a thrilling game with heart-pumping action. Highly recommended for fans of the genre!
2109430,1,136536741,Tron Lives
2156300,1,136542078,For a first episode it is fun and builds a good foundation forward. The animation and the poses were great.
