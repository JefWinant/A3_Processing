If you like physics-based platforming, speedtech, bungee grappling hooks, or traditional fae folktales, this game will be right up your alley.  I had high hopes for this game, having kept an eye on its development over the years, and it has exceeded all of them."
1811990,1,136617382,The game is absolutely amazing i can barely stop playing it. Sure the game is difficult but that just makes it more fun.
1811990,1,136617399,Giving me the vibes of when I first started playing StS and Monster train. Like that good
1811990,1,136616548,"Bought this first day it came out, literally played it for 5 hours. As a roguelike addict this one stands out. People are saying it's imbalanced but honestly after 10+ runs I'm not sure I agree. It's hard yes but also rewarding, which isn't common enough in this genre imo."
1811990,1,136617243,This game is great its a fun new-ish take on the card based rouge lite! would recommend!
1811990,0,136616580,Balancing is an issue. Unless the intent was a Souls-like Deckbuilder.
1811990,1,136616411,"I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Across the Obelisk or other roguelike deckbuilders. I would place this game on the same level as those games easily, and especially if they address some of the issues I mention below. The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.I really hope they plan on making balance changes. The game is easily worth $20 regardless, though!"
1811990,1,136616532,"Summary of the negative reviews: \"Waah the hard card game is too difficult >:(\". To address the negative reviews seriously. They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.My experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.Pros- Absolutely charming art- Fun characters- Unique and interesting card roguelike format- Card effects feel varied and uniqueCons- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards"
1811990,0,136616472,"I really wanted to give this game a positive review, but in it's current state the balancing is absolutely abysmal. For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this. I'm sure they'll patch the game to make it better, so I recommend holding off until so."
1811990,1,136616456,Wildfrost isn't unfair. The deck building is tuff. Having a bad deck make's encounters feel impossible and unfair. After playing for a while you get foresight for the synergies of cards (there are tons of them with the charm system). The deck building is very fun. The battles are very fun. 9/10 get a bigger brain.
307950,1,136617400,"Great so far!  Micro transactions, sure, but this does not seem to be a \"buy to win\" so far.  Gives you a decent amount of operators to unlock right away, but seems like it will get pretty grindy after the first few.  I am 11 levels in on my account so far and this is super addicting."
307950,1,136616458,"Been playing since 2020, love it!just a really hard grind to unlock stuff"
307950,0,136617447,This game is hogwater.GigaYikes
307950,0,136615681,No OCE or SEA servers.Borderline unplayable with high ping due to poor net code.Consider adding More servers and polishing the game before adding tons of micro-transactions.Common greed ruining games with potential.Good luck. Hopefully the game will still have players long enough for them to iron out the issues.
307950,1,136616333,better than cod. but thats not saying much. think the hero shooter style of siege but the game play of the old ghost recon online game released over a decade ago. neat indie shooter.
2198070,1,136616168,"City Building + Board Game. Not perfectly balanced, but incredibly chill. If you want to play a card game like slay the spire but also build some towns, this game is the right one."
2354600,1,136616189,"I got to see the movie a couple days early (4/11) and jumped on this as soon as I learned about it! It's easy to pick up and I've gotten sucked in for a few hours already, nearly maxing out the available stats so far lol. There's a ton of tiny movie references folks will also snicker at once they see it, and I can't wait for the full version, I may even complete a full run without dying by then!"
1527950,1,136616806,"Its got Tactical turn based old school combat with a mix of Bannerlord sandboxing and mercenary building progress to it. Not too much for stories but you can be good, bad or in the middle in this game. i would hold off until the LAG problems go away though..."
1527950,0,136617144,"Bought this at full price a week ago, in light of it nearing full release. Imagine how bumfucked i feel seeing it go on sale upon release.I have learned a lesson once again. Never EVER buy early acces. :("

2328760,0,136616752,"Step 1: Abandon your product, grab a bag of Epic money and make your existing playerbase wait 12 months for the privilege to pay for the same tables again.Step 2: Release on Steam, with everything costing MORE than it cost on Epic, for the same products.Step 3: Advertise all your reused assets as \"remastered tables\", even though they look the exact same and use the exact same assets, and the same dull lighting and the same camera angles.Step 4: Profit, because you don't care what fools buy on Steam anyway, you already have a bag full of Epic games millions."
2328760,0,136616125,"Downgrade compared to previous FX3.It barely keeps 60 fps on the steam deck on low settings, draining battery faster than AAA games like elden ring. 100% GPU usage in a pinball game...

1913870,1,136619845,"Incredible party game!Great diversity in the track generation with a Collective of so many cool BiomesLove to hang out and just vibe in the camp, or make up folk games on the spotBeautiful music all round, from the subdued instrumentals in the camp to the intense racing soundtrackSuch lovely character creationScrump!AND it's free??"
1949030,0,136618650,"Finished both, the original game as well as this version. Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole \"New Orleans\"-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.Now the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.May I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.And then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.Last Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.2/10 but only because the game looks nice"
1949030,1,136618797,"If you've played the old Awakened game, I would still recommend you try this out. Not only does the remaster really pump up the ambiance with the new graphics and improve gameplay coming from the Sherlock Chapter One mechanics, the story, while overall still the same, is still different enough to make it seem brand new."
1772830,1,136617900,Space buy this game its rly good
1811990,1,136619509,It's nearly the same as Slay the Spire and Monster Train but with different art. Balancing might be a problem though. Sometimes I get a hero so broken I don't even need to think or synergize at all to win. Other times no matter how much you plan everything out you have already lost the run because of bad RNG and you just didn't know it yet. Getting familiar with the gameplay didn't seem to mattered much. Felt like it was 80% luck to win.
1811990,1,136619463,this game is already so much fun and has insane potential.  I agree with others though that its quite unbalanced.  Still had loads of fun though
1811990,1,136619307,"I've got all of 100 minutes into the game and so far it feels pretty good, I think monster train is the most apt comparison I  can make for it, and whereas people say the RNG is brutally punishing I'm either super lucky to have made it nearly to the end in 2-3 runs (or I didn't and I don't realize how long the game is...) overall I like how the game feels. But so far devs have done an excellent job on the game! It's a gorgeous game, and it's a good time, I want to see it do well because the Devs have clearly poured a lot of heart into this game, and it is truly excellent."
1811990,0,136619316,"As most people noted, absolutely great concept but it's ridiculously unbalanced... It's not so much fun knowing that regardless of your skill you are extremely likely to lose, even against regular fights... So for now I'd say this is barely a 5.5/10, but as soon as they properly balance the game it skyrockets into a 9/10"
1811990,1,136618999,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING GAME! Art is just Beautiful!I had the opportunity receive early access and have now have played over 30 hours!Only completing my first run after 15 hours but at no point did i feel disheartened and i enjoyed the challenge.Absolutely love the variety of factions and characters with enough different mechanics that each run feels different and constantly working towards achievable meta progression goals.Like most deckbuilders the mechanics at times can seem overwhelming but taking your time with turns definitely pays off.
1811990,1,136619069,"This game is amazing. it captures all the fun of exploring new strategies building decks and running up against new enemies that you have to figure out how to beat in an amazing style with it's great graphics, music, and sound design. lots of people seem to be unhappy with the balance of the game, saying there's too much RNG, but i disagree. if you build your deck in a good enough way (which takes some trial and error) then you'll be able to deal with anything the game will throw at you."
1811990,1,136619144,I've played a few runs of this game now and really starting to enjoy it!
1811990,1,136618772,"As someone who's constantly looking for new deckbuilders to try out, I was really excited to check out Wildfrost's demo earlier this year. The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's \"hub\" is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.The game's \"ascension\" mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a \"poison deck\" because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a \"thorns deck\" because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a \"heal deck\" because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing."
1811990,1,136618704,"Very fun and challenging. A lot of people are giving this game a negative review because it's \"unbalanced.\" which I don't think is true. Since its a roguelike there's some RNG involved but when you lose 99% of the times it's because you misplayed and not because you didn't get good cards."

2328760,1,136618566,"[url=https://linktr.ee/factorofgames] Factor of Games [/url] Steam Deck Preview Here: https://youtu.be/M_citpHNKnYLet's get straight to the point; Zen Studios has delivered another solid Pinball offering with excellent licensed tables and in-house creations. They have built a better Pinball FX3, and technically the latest installment is superior to its predecessors in almost every way. Additionally, they now include instant access to Cabinet Mode, which works well for owners of Virtual Pinball Cabinets. There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! The biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. It's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. In the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.Enjoy!üéÆeeFoGeeüéÆ[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42825155/] Factor of Games Curator Page[/url]"
2328760,0,136618219,"Not impressed, \"Pro Physics\" feels like flippers are made of jelly (lack strength and accuracy), not realistic and not arcade-ish like FX3 either.And only for that change and some other minor visual improvement (that looks completely overdone and creates a lot of visual disturbance), they're charging people again if they want to play the tables they already bought in FX3 / FX2, using some ridiculous bundles to make it seems like \"it's a great deal\" for all those FX3 players.Optimization is not good either, performance is all over the place, loading times are quite high for a simple pinball game (even worse than FX3). Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.And they also sell coins that you can use to purchase monthly and yearly subscriptions. Yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to a pinball service, sure. Good luck selling this one, ZEN Studios, I'm not gonna be part of it this time."

2109430,1,136621750,"TLDR:Game is very fun but quite short although it does have high replay-ability and a interesting cast of character but maybe a bit to highly pricedthis is my first game review but i wanted to make one for this game as i really hope it gets some love and i want to share how much i enjoyed this game and hope its a sign of more Tron games to come I'm a big fan of the Tron IP and it's such a shame that so little is done with it in terms of games. So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience Set in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.The game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.Overall a great time and i hope there is more to come"
2156300,1,136621386,I really enjoyed the change of pace in Unscripted as opposed to College Kings.  I enjoy CK but I do appreciate the more down to earth approach of Unscripted.  The only nitpick so far is the inability to scroll back.  I missed a few lines of dialog because of a double-click.

The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.Balance issues are as follows:1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.I enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.For the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost."
1811990,1,136621515,"I've followed the game since its first anouncement on the Nintendo Direct a year ago. I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle. Personally I'm not a good player at all, I'm just a masochist, haha. 'Took me 10 hours to have my first victory, and let just say that a second one might take a lot more time !"
1811990,1,136621598,"Game feels amazing.  Fluid easy-to-grasp gameplay, great art and music, super super crisp UI, and it's properly challenging.  I'm sure the balancing is a little wonky, but this game was obviously designed to make you earn every fight.  I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.  I also haven't won a run yet, but I'm excited to get home from work and give it another go.  Maybe the devs should consider adding an easy mode for the whiners?"
1811990,1,136621350,"Went into this blind and won my first run. I felt like I got some nice synergies going, but definitely made some mistakes along the way due to not knowing how all the different systems worked. I made a few big blunders during the last fight as well. If you are experienced with other roguelike deckbuilders, don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews claiming the game is too difficult."
1811990,1,136621216,"[h1] IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! [/h1]If you have any experience at Roguelike Deckbuilders you will enjoy the game just fine. People whining that the game is difficult and unbalanced just don't know how to adapt to the challenge thrown at them. For reference, I finished a run on my 2nd attempt without any meta progress unlocks. While i understand people are frustrated because they have a tough time making progress, this doesn't warrant a negative review, otherwise all Souls-like games would be downvoted to oblivion. Some enemy decks will counter what you are building and the fight may be tough, but not unwinnable. I disagree on so many exaggerated claims made by various reviews that i wonder why they are playing a game from this genre in the first place."
1811990,1,136620930,"Very entertaining card game that manages to stand out from the roguelike card game horde with good artstyle and a unique battling system that reminds you of duelyst. Deep enough for replayability, however the main flaw right now is GLARING balancing issues, (Heroes are nowhere near to average in power level, same with followers, impossible to build around, card pool has no rerolls). However, these are fixable problems, and easily fixable at that. The core of the game is solid and charming, so expect this one to stay. Solid 7/10 as of no0."
1811990,0,136621208,"the game is beautiful, and I bought it due to  streaming. But honestly it is very unbalanced as there are only boss fights in every level which means big jump in difficulty.And I have to spend time to unlock rather than enjoying the game. I know we both want players to enjoy the game longer. BUT why in this way?So at the moment, i will not suggest to play this game til a big update."
1811990,1,136620825,"The game is fun and engaging if you're a fan of planning ahead and strategizing. While there are many actions happening in every turn, all enemy actions are telegraphed multiple turns ahead and once you understand the order in which they are executed, you can plan accordingly.  All those negative reviews criticising the balancing aspect are imo by players who do not enjoy this planning and don't do it thoroughly enough as it is easy to overlook something (which may even get you killed). In 4 hours I played 4 runs, won 2 of them, and died once to the final boss and once midway through. Balancing seems fine. Or maybe I am just lucky :PIf I were to criticise something its that the different abilities / status effects are not explained ideally so some interactions are initially uncleaer. This fixes itself with some more experience though."
1811990,1,136620854,"My first review ever, but I feel compelled to leave one because I cannot understand all the negative reviews on this game. I love it. The look, sound, and feel are all perfect. It puts a new, highly addictive spin on the deckbuilder genre. It is hard and needs balance, but even in its current state, it‚Äôs flat out a blast to play and we‚Äôll worth $20. Most importantly, it plays flawlessly on Steam Deck with controller support, which is a rarity for deckbuikders."

Honestly, i am not very keen on in card games but the board game-like gameplay of this game sounds interesting to me. I played it 15 hours until now and i want to say that: The game is better than i expect. The first hours of the game may be difficult for you but after you realize some mechanichs of the game it will be more delightful.  There are so many combos you can do with using cards and upgrades, so many different ways to build your town. You will be discovering all of them while playing. Considering it's an early access original indie game, i strongly recommend you to buy this game. Finally, i want to thank all the great people behind the project. Good luck with your upcoming games!"

2354600,1,136620317,"So, I don't know if there are different endings or anything like that, but I have at least completed the \"Feed\" options on all 3 levels with Renfield, so I think I have some ability to say certain things. Game is awesome. The pixelated style is a common choice for these roguelite games, but the combination of the music, the animations, and the sometimes goofy moments makes me wonder what the movie will be like. Which...is probably what the developers want, but I have to say, they do it well. So whatever gripes I may have being advertised to by a videogame are all unimportant since it worked >:)Some visual/gameplay issues I noticed. Hitboxes are not very defined. I can sometimes get right into an enemy's face without getting hit, and the others it feels like I got suckerpunched from nowhere. And that is just the melee enemies. The enemy bullets are hard to keep track of. I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls. Not having a cursor from your mouse made things a little wonky in the menu screen. At first, the game crashed on exit, but it seems that was fixed pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to win...for some time. Or maybe I am just bad at the game (:Ideas for the future? I am not going to tell the developers how to play the game, but some things I had questions on are how hard it is to understand anything. For example, the Victims you are to save or kill...I think an achievement is related to this option, but I can't determine how to go about it. I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded. Is money going to be more important in a future update? Also, the shop was a little surprising. It took me a bit to realize there were other tabs lol. Also also, the coffin was something I wasn't sure what it did until I realized I had to buy it multiple times. I had thought its effect was an upgrade I got in a run.All-in-all, the game is hectic, visually stimulating, probably a good game to watch for streamers, and if this is just the beginning, then I am looking forward to what the developers bring in the future.I will keep playing just to see if beating the levels in both Feed and Save options for both playable characters will do something. Then I will play to see if there are good synergies.(Bats, bats, we are the bats)"
1527950,0,136621775,"Very buggy. Keeps opening in the wrong monitor, doesn't seem to recognize which monitor is monitor 1-3 but also upon loading or quitting shuffles everything on monitor 1 to monitors 2 or 3. No other game or program does this so it's obviously something to do with this game. On top of that it locks up and crashes often. Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. Wait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle. Also at least one farm in the starting zone doesn't have an exit.... Hope you enjoy replaying the last autosaved battle."
1527950,0,136621651,"This might be a good single player game, but I bought this with my friend and I play most games co-op. This is not a very good co-op game because you can't do anything independently. If he clicks on a merchant, I get the box. If I close that box, it closes on his end. It's basically co-op in the sense that we might as well be a the same computer playing the same game. The art looks like those old point and click flash games. It might get better later, but there's a 2 hour return policy so I stopped playing just under that mark to get my money back."

The graphics and sound design evoke a haunting atmosphere, with eerie music and unsettling visuals that keep you on the edge of your seat.Dye The Bunny's narrative is both chilling and captivating, making it difficult to look away even when you're on the verge of screaming.

Although it is evident that this game is shorter than CO, it provides the same joy and excitement, and the discussions about Sherlock's past was a wonderful touch.

2109430,1,136622947,Fun short story in the Tron space. The setting lends itself well to interesting philosophical though. The game touches on some of that but mostly leave space for the player to think about it and as such I am sure this appeals more to the type of player who wants to replay and discover all of the possible dialogs/options.The minigame is simple but fairly easy to learn but never got super far into the digital design space - feels like a paper prototype that just worked well enough to be fun. As a whole the game shows restraint and never oversteps its bounds but as a Tron fan and a fan of the studio I would have been on board for something deeper if that is something they ever get the chance to go for.

I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health. I can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me.

1811990,0,136623144,"This game has a lot of good ideas and fantastic art and music, but it's fundamentally let down by extreme RNG.In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need. As a result, the \"rebuild and restrategise\" that's advertised, just isn't there. You roll the dice again and hope you get lucky."

307950,0,136623974,"(This Review is more in the middle than a simple yes or no)Just gonna say first of all this game is fun gameplay is actually really good but I decided to calculate how long it would take to collect all operators that are available for purchase through just the daily challenges as I have yet to unlock the weekly challenges or any of that so will update this accordingly when I get to that point. And as a addition this is without unlocking any operator upgrades or skills as the time would heavily differCredits from daily objectives:No Premium = 27,050Premium = 38,850To get all operators for a class is:100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 creditsAll together = 2,250,000 credits(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)So to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)Non Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challengesPremium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challengesIf you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)Prices for coins:2,250 coins = $11.995,000 coins = $23.99I get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a gameLike I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time"

1527950,1,136622831,Its 3D battle brothers - What more can I say to make you buy it?
1527950,1,136623718,Crazy fun. Like a turn based mount & blade.

1527950,1,136622319,I think this game is epic! Very impressed. Highly addictive once you get into it....started playing at noon...its midnight now and i cant stop!
2328760,1,136623241,"Expect a lot of reviews related to the pricing model, some justified.  If you can get past that, you have a really solid, state-of-the-art pinball game that's a meaningful upgrade from FX3.After 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  The difference is all in the physics.  There's some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it's wildly unoptimized - but what's important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It's more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is \"Classic\", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you're still after the powerups, you can find them in \"Arcade\" mode, but \"Classic\" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there's \"Pro\" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  This game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn't deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I'll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you're any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You'll be glad you did."
2328760,1,136622979,"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) The elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. No, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). Two thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game."

2077590,0,131242928,"Feels like a frustration simulator. Random attacks magically appear at increasing frequency through the waves, leading up to the final wave being an onslaught of BS moves that CC you, with the ability to default attack enemies or use the healing move being tied to standing still - which is impossible at this point. Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. There are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours."
2077590,1,133726454,"this game is infurating. Keep getting wombo comboed by the world itself. Reminds me of when I'd play LoL and get destroyed. I think the difficulty should be toned down a bit. Also different characters should have different attacks, there's not much attack variety. but it's fun nonetheless, and it's a not overpriced unlike a lot of games."
2077590,1,134333464,still early access but i've definitely gotten my $3 worth. that extra layer of dodging skillshots and traps adds refreshing depth that is truly unique among survivors games up till now. definitely had some of my most chaotic moments out of any survivors clones playing this game!
2077590,0,130907751,"I had high hopes for Sidestep Legends and I really wanted to like it because the concept is neat, but I feel like I keep going back to it and it just doesn't quite click for me. The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.The issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. Couple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.Bullet Heaven Fandom review #47.

2077590,1,130722097,"Fun and addictive gameplay, nice graphics and characters. Unlocking and trying out the different abilities gives the game a depth and level of replayability that suprises you given the low price."
2077590,1,130688887,"I recently purchased and played Sidestep Legends for three hours straight and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The gameplay was incredibly engaging and I found myself unable to stop playing. The graphics and sound design were top-notch and really immerses the player in the game world. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and addictive gaming experience."
2077590,1,130711953,I've followed this game on youtube for a while and it is developing very nicely. Quick to get into the action adn fun mechanics
2077590,1,130571366,"This is such a great twist (or should I say *sidestep*) to the arena survival genre formula. You have to strategize your in-run upgrades to create a balanced build that will allow you to have just the right amount of offense combined with defense and mobility to be able to survive the bullet hell. Lots of starting skills and they all combine and synergize with each other to create more unique skills. There's also meta-upgrades, characters and maps to unlock that makes for good replayability. The kind of game that really compels you to do \"just one more run\".Some gameplay here - https://youtu.be/f60rqswr7CQ"
2077590,1,130528878,"Addictive little game this is. Couple of fun different builds you can go for, my favourite so far is ADC.The game could need a score board, to make it easier to be competitive. My world record, as recognised by the discord community, stands undefeated so far though.Got a few maps left to play, and more builds to try out, but still recommend the game. Well worth the cost."
2077590,1,130529073,Fun gameplay and progression
1364020,1,136629194,"I've only played this game for like half an hour and i can already say that i love it!There are some issues, small bugs and glitches like buttons not working and stuttering that occur sometimes, but the game was only released to early access a few hours ago so its not a big deal.First off i've got to address the sound design which is absolutely amazing, for example the sounds from outside of your helmet are muffled in a fantastic way. Gun sound powerful and the boosters make my ears moan.\"but space doesn't have any sound\" you're free to take off your headset at any time, you'll see how fun that'll be.The Graphics are really good too, not out of this world but not bad either.The Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.The movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.Overall i think this game has great potential. With just some polishing, frequent updates and a steady playercount i can see this game become quite popular amongst FPS and space enjoyers."
