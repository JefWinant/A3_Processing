1949030,1,136628185,"I’ve patiently awaited this game, and it hasn’t disappointed.  The play style is the same as Chapter 1 (C1), despite that, I repeatedly made the mistake of not pinning evidence before using sight.  I did the same thing in C1, so this is very much a “me” problem and not an issue with the game!  There is a singular overarching main case - the story is relatively linear, with side quests throughout.  If you have a side quest in the chapter, complete it there and then – once you leave an area you can’t go back later to finish off.  I’ll be going back and replaying the first chapter for that reason – it’s not like C1 where you have free reign to go back on yourself.  There was only one thing I found annoying at times – Watson! He kept following me and then trapping me in a room and taking ages to step out the way.  I did have a glitch in the game where Watson was managing to row a boat while hovering in the air alongside it…silly Watson!  The voice acting is on point and the music and produced very atmospheric scenes.  The game is graphically stunning and leans heavily into Lovecraft, which separates it from C1 entirely.  In terms of game play time, it’s a touch shorter than I would have liked, much shorter than C1.  I’ve seen some completing it in approx. 6 hours, but for me, I’ve finished on 17 hours – I like to spend time exploring and collecting all there is to collect, racing through isn’t enjoyable for me.  I cannot leave this review without mentioning the beautifully interwoven patriotic shades of yellow and blue.  Such delicately placed nods to solidarity brought a smile to my face, and the team are to be applauded for their resilience in the face of adversity – slava Ukraini.  Overall rating 8/10"
2156300,0,136628704,wow waited all this time for a short ep not impressed more disappointed. it looks good just if you're gonna release a game release the whole thing.
1949030,1,136626064,"Combines the best parts of SH: Chapter One and The Sunken City, without the tedious combat of either."
1772830,1,136629278,"Really fun! Movement similar to Umihara Kawase, challenging combat, big fun to explore map, beautiful art and music. Definitely everything you want in a metroidvania!"
2357450,1,136628809,"The game is very well built, with several very cool mechanics and a very fluid gameplay."

1811990,0,136629200,"Everything about this game is well done, except the deckbuilding and the combat...; the two parts of the game that are the actual meat in this genre.Action economy is everything: one card = one turn. Each turn, every character on the field ticks down by 1 - and when they hit 0, they activate and do their thing. Additionally, enemies attack first, so even if your units have the same timer, they can very likely perish.This means three things:(1) Companions are better cards to than most of the effect cards, because they'll activate repeatedly AND be removed from your deck AND can tank hits for you/leader.(2) Crowns [80g item] are the best item in the shop, and the one you should make sure you can always buy. A Crown on a card means that it can be played at the start of the game for free - giving you an extra minion on the board, casting a spell for free, etc; it's a 100% draw+play at no cost (minus the one-time 80g cost).(3) The fact that your minions get weaker for the next combat after they die is ATROCIOUS. While I said companions are generally better cards to play - this is due to their stats:activation time ratio - something that is significantly weakened should they die in a fight; and makes them detrimental cards to play (since your 1 turn playing can = 6 enemy turns ticking down). If you play a minion with the same turn timer as the enemy - it's going to get hit first, and likely die - moreso if it's still injured from the prior battle.This isn't a puzzle game, it's a punishment game. Frankly, there's a lot of times where there's straight up nothing you can do to play around the enemy/board state - and on top of that, each battles designs/mechanics are extremely polarized - you either might be able to deal with it (if lucky opener+having the cards in your deck at all), or you simply cant [and there's no way to determine ahead of time what a fight might be].Honestly, this game tries to copy Quantum Protocol's gameplay, but without the designs/mechanics that actually let you get ahead on the board; despite 1 card = 1 turn for the field. If the combat is the part of the game you like most about this game, you'd do well to at least check that game out, as it's a deckbuiler-puzzle game as well (don't forget as long as it's been less than 2h playtime+2weeks owned, Steam will allow you to automatically refund a game)."
1811990,0,136628857,"Heavily unbalanced, the game ramps up WAY too fast to be fair, most of the time I die its from a sudden surge that I literally couldnt do anything about, the leaders are WAY too flimsy when them dying causes instant loss. The challenge isnt from skill, its almost purely luck based, if i try to go for any build it gets fucked by the very next draw, it doesnt allow you to build any specific deck and you dont get enough heroes to not have to worry about all your heroes being at 1 hp, most runs if I get to a boss I end up with like 4 playable characters that cant take many hits. Hell the characters MADE to take hits cant take hits as any healing is EXTREMELY rare or has an insanely high wind up, even the first battle is insanely unbalanced, expecting you to kill mountains of enemies that buff from you killing enemies or those enemies attacking, that its just completely illogical, this game needs SERIOUS fixes in its battle progression.I recommend starting with a battle thats not a million enemies constantly buffing eachother to the point that they all OHKO the card that instantly loses your game.I saw RT play this and it looked like a lot of fun, I love roguelike deck builders but this, this just feels like a mess of horrible balancing and crappy difficulty spikes.The first 2 runs wont be too bad, but after that regardless of who you pick the difficulty ramp will be too high.Ill keep my finger on the pulse of this game, watching for updates as I really want this game to be good, I want to enjoy this, but thats not something I can do with where its at now."
1811990,1,136628700,"Not super deep yet but I am loving it. It's tough, but it's just so satisfying to play and the UI/UX is so good that I don't mind at all."
1811990,1,136628536,"Fun game, but I'll have to agree about the balance problems written on most of the negative reviews. Still giving it a positive though, balance, variety and replayability is lacking but core gameplay, art and music is enough to tip the scale to positive. It's also still pretty addicting. Hoping patches can help with these problems."
307950,1,136629152,"Alright so ive made it to account lvl 12, i have 4 operators that you get to pick from a limited selection via the training tab in objectives. it would be best to diversify your collection rather than going all in on 1 class. But thats just my personal preference, You play what you want to play!Right now it seems like quite an okey game, Gunplay is nice. Not to fast and not to slow in terms of progression, So far there is plenty of incentives for players to jump in and earn. And with the steam event currently going on you can get 400 premium currency each day just by winning 5 games. and there is 6 days remaining. However with that out of the way i would like to bring up some concerning points about the gameFor starters:[b][u][i]The Bad[/i][/u][/b]- Premium skins for operators seem to cost just a bit to much. at $16 all you get for your legendary skin is a 25% bonus to XP.- Insane pricing for HQ Backgrounds. Thats right for $15 you can get a pretty little rare HQ background called mountain pass that all it serves to do is just make the background look cooler.- Operator investments gets more and more insane in terms of credit cost.- Not Everything is initially available to the player and must progress account levels in order to unlock AKA, Daily objectives @ lvl 3, New game modes at 8 & 10, Weeklies @ 12 etc etc- Premium currency conversion is a joke, 1000 coins converts to 22k credits. which is like 1-2 upgrades depending on the operators level- Limited & Restricted selection of customisation via normal progression. Meaning a camo / emotes or takedown animations you unlocked for said operator only works for said operators team AKA... KSK, Seals, Grom, CST etc etc. if you unlock a camo for KSK you cant use it for other operators youve unlocked in other teams so you need to re-unlock it which is absolutely stupid.- Onslaught game mode is honestly a joke and not even remotely difficult[b][u][i]The Good[/i][/u][/b]- Gunplay is well rounded- Can be a heavily focused team based game, played against teams that are greatly coordinated and preform their operators duties well- Amount of diverse and engaging game modes.- Somewhat evenly balanced maps, Mostly due to just being symmetrical.- Acceptable Initial Boost to new players progression, you will be earning alot of credits and coins if you played right now, But for those that join a bit to late you will still earn a great amount of credits- All operators available for credits & the store will cycle discounts for purchasing operators with credits.- Receiving duplicate rewards via RNG loot boxes will provide fragments that you are able to use on a limited selection of cosmetics for your account etc, Would be great if this was expanded upon to other cosmetic aspects.TL;DRThere is good aspects about the game but there is not particularly good that stands out for the game to shine. it lacks in alot of areas but provides a good enough gunplay and gameplay experience that you can play for an hour and be modestly satisfied. The only reason why i recommend it right now is simply because the steam event is to good of an event to pass up and unlike other games grinding such events becomes tedious but winning 5 games takes no time at all. just play against bots!5.5/10"
307950,0,136628141,"[b][h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1][/b]\"Mediocre\" is the perfect definition for Caliber: it brings nothing innovative and what it has to offer could definitely be done better. Don't let yourself be fooled by content creators, generating hype and inflating things is their job. [hr][/hr][b][h1][u]My conclusions:[/u][/h1][/b]I find this title to be a bit of a disappointment, years ago I dismissed it out of hand since Wargaming was involved and now that I have had the chance to try it I notice that, unfortunately, it is yet another missed opportunity that yes, it is playable but has that something that it lacks or could have been done better. I was hoping to find a little hidden gem, but this isn't it.The game is generic, poorly balanced and with pay to progress mechanics which are really borderline to pay to win. (in the end they are two sides of the same coin, needless to deny)After years of development I definitely expected a more advanced stage and a more defined product and less biased stuff: most of the operators are Russians, the name of the Discord is written in Cyrillic as well as most of the Discord channels, the English section is relegated to two measly channels and so on.I will update the review (for better or for worse) as soon as I have a more complete opinion.[b][u]PROS[/u][/b][list][*]The graphic is nice, unfortunately you cannot change the brightness from the settings so some scenery comes out far too bright for my taste but all in all it is enjoyable and the maps, at least as far as PvE is concerned, are enjoyable and varied. [*]Most of the animations are done well, I appreciated the fact that the developers decided to take a more tactical, slow-paced approach than most of the games coming out lately where you end up with monkeys jumping left and right. [/list][b][u]CONS[/u][/b][list][*]TTK is too high.Believe me, I'm the first to hate games where you die with very few shots and I would abolish all the weapons that bodyshot but in this case I found myself in serious trouble.Bots and players are bullet sponges, only headshots seem to do fair damage but hitreg and netcode doesn't work as it should, which is one of the many reasons I'm avoiding PvP.I also find it absurd that in first person the scope is off center on most weapons.[*]An excessive grinding (it's still a free to play title, if you want to get things in human times without having to nerd out you have to pay, there is little to do about it) combined with few things to do and a very high cost of the operators present in the game (both with game coins and real money) is the perfect matching to bore you after a few hours, even Caliber's Twitch drops are a grind...And in true Wargaming's style there is the possibility to convert real money into game currency in order to have almost everything immediately, in some ways it feels more like a mobile game.[/list][u]My components:[/u]RTX 3060TI 8GBI5-9600K 3.70Ghz16 GB RAM DDR4 3000mhz"
307950,1,136628815,"This game is fun, if not a little annoying from time to time.The Progression system sucks, The points you use to level up skills should not be connected with how you unlock ops. I know this is a fReE gAmE and whatnot, but the grind just seems beyond ridiculous if you want new ops/camos. Since I can’t play Future Soldier or Phantoms again this is a good substitute. And for a free2play it’s not that bad."
307950,0,136628224,"Some of the worst netcode, gunplay, damage models and monetization I have ever seen. Don't let your nostalgia for SOCOM sucker you into giving this a fair chance, it doesn't deserve it and it does not care about its players."
307950,0,136627850,this game so badly made some futures not respond proper and so many cheaters in game its not ok if i wanna put some money on it not recommend this game

307950,1,136626733,"Drippy operator designs, with over 70 operators to choose from, each one with unique skillset, weapons, gear, outfits, and belonging to many European and global factions, best part, 90% of them are obtainable by means of free gameplay. As of their current Steam release, the newbie welfare tasks and rewards are pretty decent, though how free currency will be gained further down the line is still up to speculation. Gameplay wise, animations might seem a bit stiff, but overall still quite immersive. The russian voiceovers are also a bit more emotive than the english ones. Decent replay value, though one problem is when I have to go AFK due to external circumstances, the game will impose an increasing increment of a time limit that restricts you from playing that game mode each time you go AFK; hopefully they'll address that because some players aren't trying to ghost teammates but are simply forced to leave due to real-life obligations, though of course I understand solutions to such issues are easier said than done.Game modes are pretty interesting, consisting of a variety falling under the main categories of PvE, PvP, and a combination of both, which is PvPvE. There's mini storylines and cutscenes for each mission to introduce the setting. (As someone who is more of a TPS than an FPS enjoyer (even though I am fine with playing both), because I like being able to see my character in combat, and not just their hands and legs. Its a decent addition to TPS games out there (and its free too), given how FPS games have vastly saturated the market in comparison. I never really thought about the TPS corner peeking argument or whatever because when you play TPS as a whole you don't really care about that since its not that big of an edge, just a different form of gameplay.)"

307950,1,136626441,"Played a lot of Caliber before it came to steam, happy to see it on steam. Some really really fun enjoyable moments, but then you occasionally run into a boring frustrating match, with team mates who's playing Free-For-All or something, not helping anybody but themself. Oh well. Fun game eitherway!"
1893370,1,136628278,"[h1]Probably the best way for the 90s Arena shooter to take form[/h1]I'm sure we've seen our fair share of games trying to bring back the classic arena shooter to modern PC gaming, from Quake Champions fading to obscurity to the entirety of the Unreal franchise being erased from Epic Games' portfolio. Rather than retread familiar ground, Daev Team decided to take a left turn and have a story-based singleplayer game carry these familiar mechanics and level design.[h1]Story[/h1]Since this is meant to be invocative of 90s arena shooters, Ghostware is a game-within-a-game story where you died in the real world and are brought back from the dead with little memory of who you were in life, forced to fight against other undead spirits in a deserted multiplayer FPS by The Wizard, a stereotypical fat nerd reminiscing about the glory days (in his point of view) of multiplayer FPS where you've probably fond memories of spawning in as a free kill and getting ganked before you could even reach a weapon spawn with nothing to defend yourself with beyond a wimpy pea shooter.As someone who has grown up with more than my fair share of ZDAEMON and Zandronum with a bit of UT2004 sprinkled on in my childhood, I was able to get into the setting of the game and while I do like how the lore tidbits are collected through URLs viewed through a totally-not-Netscape browser, it does get a little difficult and confusing to follow the game's backstory due to 90s web design being what it is.[h1]Gameplay[/h1]For the better portion of the game, Ghostware can best be described as a stripped-down UT99 with fewer weapons, along with the addition of activated abilities that you can unlock as the story progresses. I personally don't mind how those abilities are implemented, though later ones that you unlock are definitely overpowered to the point where it'll be difficult to justify using whatever the upcoming Episode 2 has in store when you can just heal yourself willy-nilly during the more story-focused levels. I can say with full confidence that this game's definitely not for everyone but players who grew up with the old-school deathmatch games will likely be a fan of what Ghostware has in store[h1]Other[/h1]Being a game invocative of 90s multiplayer FPS, I can't help but think that progressing through the story or collecting certain pieces of lore should unlock levels and player models to use in the Instant Action mode. So far, the only things you get for that are the abilities you use in the Story Mode. One other nitpick I have is relating to a late game spoiler but [spoiler]personally, I think there should be a drastic change in artstyle in 03_CTF3 due to that map taking place in the real world. Sure, I get that the low-fidelity visuals are part of the game-within-a-game setting, though I think there should be a lot more in the way of visual distinction between the game world and touching (in-game) grass[/spoiler]Overall, this is definitely not a game for most people but I think this is definitely something to keep your eyes open for if you've grown up with the likes of Unreal Tournament and/or Quake 3 Arena."
1893370,1,136629075,"The nostalgia really pulled me in, the dial up tone from my teen years and the old computer :) reminded me of unreal engine, doom 64 and a few other games. I struggled a lot with jumps, unsure if bugged sometimes but I know I'm also bad at jumping in any game XD the arenas are super fun although some of the bots often just stood there and let me kill themWill definitely play again to get through current part I'm stuck on"

1795470,1,136627353,"I had a chance to play a pre-release version of the game before and now I've tried the 1.0. I loved every bit of it!I'm not good at reviewing games, so I'll keep it simple:PROS+ unique mechanic of a shrinking island+ nice graphics (although maybe not everyone's cup of tea)+ good value for money (story mode + skirmish + endless)+ addictive gameplay+ clear tutorialCONS- sometimes it may be difficult to tell some buildings apart (especially when they're the same type, next to each other, but on different levels)- sometimes ships don't move the way you'd expect them toOverall, it's a solid indie game that delivers its premise and, despite minor flaws, is really fun to play."

2328760,1,136629183,"Amazing lighting with HDR and Raytracing and most tables just look better all around. The only legal place to play classic Williams recreations like Twilight Zone, Swords of Fury, etc. It's only gonna get better. Trust me, we have come a lonnnnnnng way from over a year ago when the game hit early access. We now have proper portrait mode and all new tables will only be available in the new platform and not FX3. Negative reviews are from haters who want free table upgrades when this is not a simple port job. Everything had to be built in a brand new engine (Unreal) and it took a lot of man-hours. Further, Zen announced that old tables would not be free upgrades literally two years ago and have never changed their stance on that. Zen actually communicated this very clearly many times, but I guess not everyone got the message. Devs have to eat, too.Yes, there are inconsistencies in that some Williams tables like Black Rose have a highly spammable center broadside shot (not present in FX3 where it is a lot harder to hit) and many Williams tables play easier than they did in FX3 (and I would argue easier than real life as well). There are exceptions though, Space Station is still hard as is Dr. Dude and Whitewater. We still need custom cameras and multiplayer Battle Royale mode added as promised and we need VR (due to come out this year) but we are well on our way folks. Ignore the haters and grab this game! And hey, you have three free-to-play tables including Fish Tales, so what have you got to lose? Free one day Pinball Pass as well so you can play everything and see what is worth it to you. Another hit against the haters!"

1649740,1,136628148,"Firstly, if you're a Steam Deck owner, who, like me, trawls Steam reviews and forums to see how a game runs, let me open by saying that Hunt the Night runs perfectly 'out of the box' and is a fantastic handheld experience! Hunt the Night is a brutal beast of a game. On appearance, it seems similar to fellow pixel-art horror titles like Vivette and Lamentum. I expected a story driven affair, with puzzles and light combat akin to a top-down Zelda. What I got was a tough-as-nails 2D action RPG like Bloodborne. From an indie perspective, the game I found 'Hunt the Night' most similar to was 'There is No Light'. Now, let me be frank: this is one difficult game. You will die, and die a lot. Patience is an absolute pre-requisite to progression. The bosses are challenging, initially frustrating, but not impossible. After several quick deaths to the second boss, an anthropomorphic bird creature, I had to take a break to rethink my approach. You will not get anywhere by button mashing in this game.Your character, Vesper, has a close combat move, a ranged attack, a dash and a special move. Early on, your magical moves make little difference but it becomes a key tool in your arsenal as the game progresses. Weapons come in a variety of forms, some are slow but powerful, others quick but inflict less damage. The dash move depletes your stamina bar, so you must use it sparingly. And this is where I made some early mistakes. My advice to anyone picking up this game would be to make every dash count. Watch enemy patterns, look for their tells, and listen to the sounds when they make different moves. Another fatal error was trying to get too many swipes of my weapon into one attack. With bosses, I initially went in 'all guns blazing' and attacked at any opportunity. Later, after several deaths, I chose my moments carefully. I decided against being greedy, attacking with a single swipe and moving away, and using my dash to avoid the most devastating attacks. Perseverance is key. These bosses will not go down easily, and, just as you have got on top of their moves and taken half of their energy, they unleash a second phase of new attacks. It's worth mentioning that the game is not all combat. There are plenty of puzzles, from simple button pressing and finding keys to open locked doors, to more story driven object placement, similar to 'Silent Hill'. I never found the puzzles a chore, or something which affected the pace of the game, In fact, they give you more reason to scour each dungeon or the outer world (as well as provide welcome relief from the intense bosses).Sadly, there is no map to keep a check on where you've visited, or where you have to go. I found myself getting lost on occasion, particularly after leaving the game and returning to it after playing other games. I had a similar problem with 'There is No Light', although the developers added a map of sorts to that game post launch. I've really enjoyed my time with 'Hunt the Night' so far, and feel I am now in sync with what the game expects of the player. This is not an easy game to play, and may be too much for some. But, if you have enjoyed From Software's 'Bloodborne',  this is the closest thing to a 2D 'de-make' I've played. The challenge is great but the rewards greater."

Imagine Mount and Blade Banner Lords and bit of an Age of empire but In a Cute fairytale world with a bit of City builder elements to it 1 - This is a very fairy tale esque unique world full of cute mythological characters 2 - You start with a small pair of two men and women and with time and patience turn it into a massive empire 3 - You can talk to the kings and queens of other regions and even get married to them or fight them and takeover them , destroy them 4 - This is also the world of magic so expect magic spells and curses from time to time 5 - You can also espionage on other kingdoms 6 - There are world events that keep on happening throughout the game that will affect you in many ways in a both positive and negative sense 7 - You can also build a massive army 8 - You have hero camps in this - Heroes can travel in interact with interesting objects in the world , you can control the heroes yourself , although they can only walk in your area so you have to expand your region 9 - You can expand your region easily by purchasing the nearby lands 10 - Dynamic weather systemOverall - 10/10 ( GO FOR IT )"
1778060,1,117822934,"It's free to play and very early access so I'm not giving it a thumbs down, but it is not super tolerable to play yet.PROS - It's D&D with the To Hit and Damage Rolls- It doesn't look half bad- Good visual cues on how far you can moveCONS- Still buggy... hitting End Turn doesn't work very often and ultimately I had to exit the game because I couldn't end my turn- Moves VERY SLOWLY; e.g., the dice rolling needs to be about 2x its current speed. As is, requires a lot of patience just to move two guys around and attack.- The music, even if it's a placeholder, is intolerable- The bit I played doesn't seem to have any narrative or dialogue, so not very Table Top IMO"
1651560,1,136631108,"I waited a long time for this game. I wanted to be the first to review. Never planned what i'd say. That's itI'll keep editing my review the more I play. So far I have a nice little shire going. My people carrying their baggins of goods all over. Can't quite place why this music seems so familiar....Alright then, keep your secrets......"
1778060,1,135331341,"[h1]Before I played Roll For Initiative, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
1778060,1,117532552,"So, I'm writing this while it's in an Alpha stage, I think? Pre-Alpha might be more accurate. In case it changes in the future, I got this game free because it is currently free. Also, It only says 5 minutes played because I was playing offline. Now, with all that said...This game has potential. I like the concept, and even the story is sort of nice, though it's only told through implication.You start in 'Town,' and it's inhabited by Scottish guards who greet you with 'ho's there?' and 'Let's get 'em!' and proceed to try and slash the protagonists, BowGuy and NotKnifeGuy (you throw it, and BowGuy kept getting it, I think because he'd kill whoever the knife got thrown at?). Fortunately, if you get lucky and don't roll 1.0 damage a bunch, they go down pretty quick. After getting through them, you enter a chapel, where a Scottish vaguely-green skeleton warrior greets you by slashing at you. And you lose, because he's got a lot of health.After that, you get put into the 'Dungeon.' Fortunately, they forgot to lock your cell, or even put a door on it, or even put you in a cell. You leave the NotCell and are accosted by Scottish werewolf guards who slash you. After beating them, you could go right or left, but going right is completely pointless, so I don't recommend it (I did and it didn't help).As our heroes fight through the Dungeon, I feel obligated to mention a few problems I noticed. First, the End Turn button is a little tricky, you have to click below the text for it to work; or press T, which worked more reliably. Another being, the Dungeon is very laggy. Very. Maybe it's just me, but my computer (which is admittedly not made for gaming) could handle the other one/two (I'll get there) levels fine. Furthermore, two of the guards didn't despawn, fall over, or even lose their healthbar when killed, which was very confusing at first. But worst of all, a lot of times, after clicking the square where you want to go, though your character does move there, the graphic doesn't more. That's bearable (if confusing at first) but it's worse: the game is half-oblivious to it, rolling the dice on the misplaced graphic and MOVING THE CAMERA TO IT, NO MATTER HOW FAR AWAY THE ACTION ACTUALLY IS, which can be a little inconvenient when FOLIAGE AND WALLS STOP YOU MOVING AND ATTACKING ON SQUARES YOU CAN'T SEE, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DRAG THE CAMERA BACK EVERY FIVE SECONDS.Included in all of this was this situation: I came up on an enemy from behind a wall, so it couldn't see us. I left the pretty hurt BowGuy behind so he wouldn't lose health on this random werewolf. I walk out from behind the wall, he sees me. I attack him. BowGuy stays behind the wall that was JUST HIDING US. And the werewolf WALKS PAST ME, BEHIND THE WALL, AND ATTACKS MY COMPANION, HURTING HIM EVEN MORE.*Calming breaths.*Anyhow, after getting through the dungeon, there's another Scottish green skeleton guy, but he's much easier to beat up, though the character/camera broke again and... well, you get the point.After beating him and getting the 'PLAYER FACTION WON' message, you go to the next, third, unlisted level.You spawn in and it's icy, and less laggy, and you know immediately that this level is going to be special. Why? Because in the chat box that error messages and Player_Movement4 type messages were popping up in, was the messages 'LIGHTING HAS BEEN CHANGED (909 objects)' and 'LIGHTING HAS BEEN CHANGED (2 objects)' were there in red and white, and below them in faded text read something like 'disable text to disable.' Forward slash didn't open the chatbox, by the way.There's only one enemy on this map, another skeleton guy (he turns out to be Scottish when you get close enough). You move close, and let loose a shot with the longbow that he doesn't react to. Move a little closer, and he reveals his heritage and moves forward to attack. Then, you discover that BowGuy has a Spear now. How useful! So here you stand, ready to fight. Skeleton Man comes in to attack, and you know 'cause you shot him that he's got a lot of health, so this will be a tough fight. But you can feel in your hearts that this fight will end a reign of terror, free the Town and Dungeon from his evil grasp, and even though one of you may die, you will live on a legends, true heroes, who ended the reign of the evil Green Skeleton.He walks in range, and then does nothing. This enemy, presumably, isn't programmed with attacking yet. Not just that, him not attacking freezes the turn. He literally pulls a Sans on you, never ending his turn so you can't attack. This is your cue to press Escape on the game and go back to the Main Menu.If you've gotten though all this, you can probably tell I didn't have a super great time with my hour in this game. So why am I recommending it? Because I believe that the game will get better. Maybe that's a vague hope, a foolish hope, and old man's dream of a good D&D style game. But it is my hope and dream none-the-less, so I cast this stone in favor of a chance, that one day, perhaps, this game will reach greater heights."
1778060,1,117418667,"Still very buggy, but a good start. Interestingly the game is called, \"roll for initiative\", but the one thing you don't do is roll for initiative. I was scoring hits about 80% of the time. And at one point my characters were not updating on the correct spots on the map."

1949030,1,136632975,"Game is great, the story is captivating BUT, - more puzzels- more side quests - more dlc - more achievementsand I will love this game"
2109430,1,136633057,I love the art and the puzzles!
2109430,1,136631398,"Great game that utilizes an underrated IP. Perfectly combines sound, visuals, and storytelling to create a brilliant aesthetic.Wish there were a few more options for the branching narrative to buff replayability, but still a very compelling story for my first run. Looking forward to seeing more Tron related media in the future!"
1694740,0,136632296,"I hate to have to give this a negative review, but the controls are not proper in my opinion. Instead of thrust, WASD allows you to \"dodge\". Oddly, you have to hold down shift in order to thrust. This was unwieldy, so I changed thrust to W and just let that evasion direction go. But without reverse thrust, it's still too difficult to properly maneuver. I'm far from bad at video games, but with this kind of control scheme, I found it fairly impossible to beat even the second stage boss.Maybe the controls are such that you're meant to use the dodge buttons exclusively in combat, but the game doesn't make this clear and I'm not sure if that would work better. And also, that's not really how \"dodge\" is supposed to be used.That being said, I do like the other aspects. I like how the mining probes work, and the mechanics to force you to leave a sector after a certain time. I like the upgrade system too.That being said, without a revamp of the control scheme, I can't recommend this game."
1811990,1,136633035,"Don't normally review games, but the reviews have kind of done this one dirty, so I'm dropping this in case the \"Mixed\" (at the time of writing) turns someone off.This game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.Negative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the \"balancing\"). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.The art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update. Check the game out if this sounds interesting to you!"
1811990,0,136632630,"Looks great but that's where the good ends. The combat is wildly unbalanced. Typically your choices won't make any differences and you will quickly lose again and again. Its not a matter of difficulty, but RNG. I'm also getting tired of bad games designing around the refund window."
1811990,1,136632896,One of the better card games. Maybe tune down the difficulty a bit.
1811990,1,136632591,"Found this game through Retromation, and it's as fun as it looks"
1811990,0,136632091,"Wildforst seems like an exciting take on the card battling genre at first. However, there are a few issues that I have with the mechanics/descriptions that the game fails to inform you of correctly.Firstly, I was under the impression that aimless meant the enemy or ally could even hit someone that was on their team, this does not seam to be true and honestly I prefer it that way but the wording for the description of aimless makes it unclear.Secondly, and this is why I believe I need to rate the game poorly, mechanics such as soulbound skulls do not work as described. It and items similar to it specifically state that it targets a random ally. In my best run (thank the RNG gods) I used the item and it soulbound my leader which meant that I could not kill the enemy I needed to or I would die... The enemy I soulbound was the boss soooo that did not work out for me.My third major issue is in reference to me thanking the RNG gods because like many have previously stated the difficulty spike in this game is insane. I've played games like Slay the Spire, One Step From Eden, Ring of Pain, Darkest Dungeon, and Inscryption yet this somehow feels much greater in difficulty and what many people are calling out as only a few viable builds are correct.I desperately want the developers to fix these issues and I know the game was only recently released, but these are my issues and I hope the feedback pushes the ball forward in terms of Wildfrost being improved."
1811990,0,136631992,"In its current state, no.  It reminds me of a very bare bones Monster Train.  I would wait for this to be on sale for at least half off or for them to add more content, quality of life and balance updates.  ProsThe animations and city building aspect are great.  Randomized heroes are fun.   ConsThe not being able to pass on a card mechanic is tiresome. The balance is, as others have said, a little out of whack.It's very tedious and grindy after a few runs, and not in a fun way like Slay the Spire.The insane amount of passives the enemies have vs what you can actually get.There doesn't seem to be a wide variety of cards to chose from."
1811990,1,136632353,"The art looks cute, but the game play is quite challenge. The time on each run is much shorter than StS or Monster Train. But no \"restart battle\" option, so you have to think through all the moves in advance. If you like deck building then give it a try, not that pretty as the art for beginner level players."

1527950,1,136631322,"Wartales......By far one of the best strategy RPG/Tactical games in a long time and incredibly welcome for a change. The developers have put so much into this game, from the small engaging mini games, to the detail in each game system, whilst not too complex, providing that level of depth to keep you engaged as you go throughout your journey in the world.The world itself is relatively alive and you can be ambushed, attack other parties and so on, engage in conversation and events with persons and merchants and so on.The combat is easy enough to adapt to if it is  not your go to and provides a degree of entertainment beyond a simple turn based game. With inclusion of cinematic cutscenes every now and then and the gore and so on. Combat is satisfying and the shear volume of makeup and parties you can have from mercenaries and animals alike leaves you with plenty of choice.The game mechanics are sound, criminal systems, repercussions for your actions in the world and a reputation based system that forms over time in the form of paths and knowledge. Overall supported from early days of development and by far one of the best EA titles I have supported to date and they deserved every penny. Will definitely be supporting Shrio Games in the future and hope they have many successful projects to come!"
1527950,1,136630011,"I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised. It' s basically Battle Brothers but I found it to be much more engaging. If you are looking for a SRPG with solid and tactical combat and an intersting world to explore, this game is for you."

I love that they kept a lot of the charming artwork and layout of the first game, so right away it feels comfortable and familiar. Also I discovered the existence of the tiny tiny birds and I screamed. Everything is so so cute and fun and I just feel so happy while playing this game. The devs really created such a lovely game with such cute artwork! I definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the music/artwork of games like Animal Crossing, Terraria, or older SNES games like Kirby Superstar.

The game's graphics are nice, but that's about it with this game, the atmosphere is really lacking something to make it scarier and more immersive. Its gameplay is not that fun either because you only have to go from room to room to find the key for the next room (I think I've used the camera or something other than the keys to open one door but the game does not tell you much so I don't know exactly what I did lol). There is only 1 enemy in this game and it seems that it does not follow you everywhere (just on the floor you spawn) and when it catches you, you take damage from him but he does not move at all while attacking you lol. This game really does need some work but it is really cheap and for just 1$ you can support an indie dev and his work."

It's a small developing team not a Triple A title, there are going to be bugs. If you want a near perfect game go buy a $70 title at GameStop not a $12 game on Steam.The bugs are minor, the development team is releasing patches and fixing them as they are found so that isn't the issue.The game is fun if you like games like Gold Miner or Out of Ore where you are performing mindless repetitive tasks like removing dirt and selling it to buy new equipment.The problem is the actual mining takes little to no effort so it is incredibly easy to buy everything the game has to offer in one play session leaving you virtually nothing to do after.I can only hope the dev team has much more in store for DLC to increase replay value. There in game store contained a train in the demo that is not there in the finished game so there's hope they have more in store."
1949030,1,136633163,"Hello, this is the Man of Chaos speaking!Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is now officially live past two days. As a fan of past Frogwares games, even tho I am getting into some older ones in recent times, I liked the games I have played.It was one of the main things I have decided to back the game on kickstarter one year ago, or how long it was already, the time passes by so quickly.Quick disclaimer: I have not played the original game, or the remaster of it. Wanted to finish this remake of a game and now I shall play older ones, since I wanted to play this one blind.So, how did the game go? It is not an open world, neither it is not that narrow as one would expect. Played the game with Premium edition which includes small sidecases, which I deemed interesting, even tho they are nothing that ground breaking, since it is not the main focus of the game. Also by completing those, you acquire costumes, which in one half of a game you can wear, on the other half you have clothes limited because of the plot reasons, on the other hand, when you get to those, you have a lot to choose from, for Sherlock and for Watson. I had fun and I believe you will have too.For the main story, we have seven episodes, each getting you somewhere else with like two minor exceptions, which I will not speak of, as it might compromise the story a little bit. Nonetheless, they are nice locations to go through and I enjoyed every single one. As it is more linear style of game than previous Chapter One, there are those sidequests and the main plot, yet at some places it feels like there is not much, in another time it feels like there is a lot things at a spot. When it comes to difficulty settings, I do not know how much of a difference there is, since I ran it on the hardest difficulty. Difficulty has its toggles and you can enable and disable things as much as you like. At some parts, I had to make a toggle two times because of a reconstuction of a crime that took place, and I had no idea what I have done wrong. On the hardest difficulty you will see that you have done something wrong, but if you lower the difficulty, you can see exactly which ones does not fit the narrative so you can move past the sequence, because mainly it gives information which you use into other informations to know what to do, or where to go next. At some places I have run into a difficulty of finding some things which were there, and was looking for them for some time before I actually stumbled upon them. The game does offer you a radar saying what you can interactive with, but it seems to highlight things in an area where you stand or what you can interact near the spot, hard to tell how it works. Just be aware that some things can be missed, although you will get to it eventually since it might be a part of the crime scene where you need all elements anyway. Connecting information to know where to go next or how to deal with an important situations? We have that as well, in another variant of mind palace! I had run into some things being a trial and error, because you never know, if you have already enough information for it to click or not, or when you know what you are looking for, it might take some other information to select than what you would think, even tho after making it the way the game wants, you kinda get it as well.Story wise? Do not come looking for Chapter One or Crimes & Punishments, since its little of both. Mainly, it is a continuation of Chapter One, which was a reboot of Sherlock Holmes. This is what follows Chapter One. I had a lot of fun, mainly since I knew nothing of the previous games that this is based upon. Game has some horror aspects, mainly to the name of Lovecrafts. Those scenes are not there that often when thinking over the game, but they aren't there nor redundant or something that would hinder the game. At a part of the game I felt disgusted, because I do not take some things that easily, even tho there is nothing really appaling. Story in a lenght is like 9-10 hours, last (my nearly 11th hour) I hunted few achievments that I missed. On the other hand, I have loved the game, even when some would consider it short. The game takes you in shoes of Sherlock Holmes and Watson really well and I am grateful for it. Also the game has a lot of refferences and I loved to see them, if you played other Sherlock games, you might find them as well ^^I regret nothing, liked the game from start to the end. The side cases, the places you went to visit, all the emotions, puzzles, all of it. You can go through the game as you like, since thanks to difficulty settings you can play at your own tempo, at your own terms. I do recommend this game, as much as all those games I have played by Frogwares so far! I am looking for another release by Frogwares, already feeling stoked what comes next. Approved by the Man of Chaos."

1772830,1,136633228,"Played a couple hours of the Steam NextFest demo which sold me on the game (and even carried my save game over! though I'll need to replay start for achieves probably).If you're on the fence I recommend just buying and playing it a bit, the bungee grapple will probably take a while for me to master, but within the 2 hour refund window you should be able to discern if it's the kind of thing you want to figure out or if it doesn't jive with you.Shame there's no longer a demo, not sure I would've got it otherwise, or at least as quickly. I know Ultrakill is something I immediately hopped on after playing the demo, where I might've waited a bit longer after it got more hyped up to get it, but I think if you like what you see with the Rusted Moss gameplay, you'll probably have fun if you can clear the difficulty floor of the bungee."

1811990,0,136635207,"So... Fuck this a hard one to write because while I do love so many many aspects of this game, and probably will keep playing it. I do get why it's getting a mixed score. Usually, I don't write reviews but for card games in particular I feel like I have enough experience to properly rate them somewhat.Do I think the game is a horrible mess? No. Do I think it's as good as the genre mainstays like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, also No but it can be. It has some AMAZING qualities, the art style of course, the faster-paced gameplay, and I really like the combat that puts so much emphasis on the countdown mechanics etc. However as many have stated the game is wildly unbalanced or at least unbalanced enough that it feels like it's impossible to have good runs. I definitely feel like this issue can be fixed, I am not a developer so I can't say how, but I know it's possible! And I still have hope for this gameThe developers have made an amazing game and I really hope they take in the good that they've made here, this is a strong foundation. The clock that you use to refill your hand is such a neat mechanic. Injuries make you feel like you're a team rather than a deck of cards. This game doesn't just present a game like Slay the spire it presents a world silly as it might be.If the release is the end of the road for this game, then I am happy enough with the product even if I don't recommend it. However, if this game gets a balance update and maybe just a few updates I think this can be a gem!"
1811990,0,136635511,"first steam review for a disgusting dev team with NO RESPECT to player feedback.not a newbie, i've played at least 50+ roguelike/lite games since the binding of issac; dead cells, splunky, slay the spires, monster trains, u name it.i agree with most bad reviews: the difficulty curve of this game sxxks, just because of bad game balance design. and guess what? the dev announce that \"we've noticed a large amount of bad reviews from chinese-language players and .......... here's some tips for ya. blahblahblah.\"rediculous. unbelievable. with no respect to people who expect to play your game and wait for such a long time. at least you can say \"we will carefully re-consider the difficulty design, perhaps add an easy mode (take the current version as the normal mode) in the future.\"and no. fxxk u. feel so stupid to trust u and pay u."
1811990,1,136635431,"Unsure why people think this game is too hard.... I was a bit worried after reading some negative reviews, but I bit the bullet and bought it, and the game is fantastic. I'm unsure where people are having issues with winning, as the game feels perfectly challenging. You can't play this game by just hoping you're so powerful it's brain dead, there is more thought that gets put into each battle. Definitely give it try if you're on the fence."
1811990,1,136634405,"Good game with similar beats from Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Darkest Dungeon. 10/10 art and clear interface.I beat the final (final) boss and I can see why people are complaining about the game being difficult, but that's what makes good roguelike games. It would not be fun if you could just brainlessly steamroll everything. My advice to new players is if they are familiar with other deckbuilders, the key is to make your deck concise so when you redraw, you get the same set of tools. You will just need to know what can handle what scenarios. The difficulty really is just a learning curve like all roguelikes. Also a UX suggestion for the devs: add death previews when it's obvious. For example if an item is obviously going to kill an enemy, have an X show up or something. Conversely, when an ally is obviously going to die at the end of the turn at a position, make it highlight red or something. With the number of things happening in this game, sometimes players can miss the obvious (I certainly have o-o) and this will make the game possibly feel easier.Overall I look forward to trying new builds and would recommend this game to anyone who really wants a brain tickler."
1811990,1,136634077,"Since reviews for Wildfrost (at the time of release) are so polarized, i figured i'd share my own early impressions.I really enjoy the core gameplay, you and your enemy's cards being on two separate lanes leads to tough decision-making situations and the cards you find throughout your run can have neat interactions with one another thanks to interesting but simple to understand keywords and card effects.Wildfrost feels hard but rarely in a mean way, some runs do end prematurely but i feel like that's just the game punishing misplays (perhaps too harshly for some).I'm obviously not far enough into the game to comment on how balanced it actually is, so i'll just say that the difficulty hasn't really lead to any strong frustration for me so far.  If you've played card battlers like this before and don't mind being slapped around a bit when you first get into a game, i recommend Wildfrost ! If you're more of a casual enjoyer or the idea of doing ascensions in Slay the Spire repulses you, you should probably wait until some balance patches and maybe even difficulty options are introduced before you make the jump."
1811990,1,136634848,"Git gud, guys"
1811990,0,136633287,"This game is extremely difficult, but not due to good mechanics or an ounce of balancing. This game is purposefully made difficult by severely nerfing the player's chances, and RNG are a joke. The scaling is abhorrently unbalanced, where the player has very little control over how their deck is built or how to synergize anything, since all your loot and cards and companions are RNG without any option to re-roll or decline a card option. Overall, while it is cute and has some fresh concept, it is poorly implemented where the only way they could make the game challenging is to make the player weak."

1811990,1,136633068,"Was on the fence after reading the reviews. Been on my wishlist for over a year now. Big fan of card battlers and clocked hundreds of hours in StS across multiple platforms.Have lost all 10+ runs so far. Needs to be rebalanced, but a lot of fun and well worth the full $20."
307950,1,136635371,"While third person shooters are seen as almost the pineapple pizza of video games, ive always had a soft spot for the genre.the movement feels very simple but is far from clunky. the operators look amazing and are super fun to collect and grind for.overall a very great game that is worth checking out if the term third-person doesnt make you vomit"

307950,0,136633182,"The idea of the game is good, but the server connection situation is bloody horrible. The lag is not only happened when I combat with other players, and it also makes me cannot reconnect my special operation game. At the end, I must abandon my teammates and got the punishment. As a OZ hardcore gamer, I feel sad be abandoned from nearly all gaming companies in the world...they might charge us the top level price and give a s,h,i,t to us like that...X("

Get one day of pinball Pass for free and play 70% of the tables right now.I DID NOT play the 3DS zen pinball game but wen I was a kid I played a little game called \"Big Race USA\" which took my understanding and love for pinball to the next level.I want to talk about the history I have with the Pinball FX  franchise.  There's a ton of love but also some painful things.XBOX LIVE ARCADE.  Xbox 360 i was introduced to Pinball FX.  Okay, it ran at a terrible 60FPS but it was almost the definitive version.  It had local SPLIT SCREEN.  it had 4-player Online Multiplayer with our avatars in the 4 corners.  I owned all of the tables.Welp, i NEVER owned an Xbox One and never played Pinball FX2 on an XBONE so that means I LOSE ALL MY TABLES.But that's okay because Pinball FX2 VR comes out and now I can put my face INSIDE of the table.They added a few DLCs.  Def not enough.  (Balls of Steel in VR would've been appreciated.  idk.)Now I've been buying tables on Steam anytime there's a sale.  I own a decent amount.It's like rebuilding my old library.  And Now it seems like I don't own any again.Apparently I own \"Heavy Hitters\" on Pinball FX3.  A $10 pack of tables.  (probably got it on sale.)But it says I can complete the pack for $5 (50% off).  So if you buy Pinball FX tables you get the Pinball FX3 table with it.Who's going back to Pinball FX3?  I guess Me cuz why do we pay $5 for raytracing? I actually own one month of Pinball Pass on my Xbox Series X and playing it on there a little.  And that seems like the route to go.I will prob buy the new tables on here tho.  I like the Godzilla one!"

The game is really cheap and offers about half an hour of gameplay in which you can finish the game 2 times to get the both endings. You really won't do much in the game, just walk to find Easter eggs to be able to pass the area. It has some jumpscares, weird sounds, the graphics are old school and the story is a short Easter themed one."

1649740,1,136634346,"Absolutely rock solid. A top down action game with strong combat, something akin to Bloodborne, though with shooting almost like a twin stick shooter, albeit a bit more deliberate. It's fast, precise, pretty tough, but fair. You have to juggle multiple types of attacks which flow together nicely, making encounters almost puzzle-like as you figure out the best strategy and maximize the use of your resources. The aesthetic is quite strong as well, with stellar art direction. I confess that I'm finding the narrative a bit abstruse at the moment, but that might clear up with time. The important part is that it has enough intrigue to pull me along, and a powerful core combat element that makes it worth exploring. A definite recommend!"
1649740,1,136634962,"Hunt the Night is a very enjoyable experience that often left me feeling frustrated upon defeat but having that outweighed by my need to simply try again and be victorious.

1968710,1,136637047,"MEATGRINDER is a perfect showcase of what happens when a small team has a singular driving vision and don't get bogged down by adding in every idea they can think of. The core gameplay is all about jumping on moving vehicles and feeling like a badass and every design element in the game is there to make you feel just like that. The weapons are super chunky and satisfying, the challenge is adequate and even though the game isn't that long, the game is pretty replayable because of the short setpiece levels and the infinite mode. I got a review copy for free, but that doesn't impact my review in any way, I genuinely like the game.
