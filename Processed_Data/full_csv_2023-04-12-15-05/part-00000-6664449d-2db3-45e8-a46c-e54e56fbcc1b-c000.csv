1967310,0,136567436,"I gotta give the dev props for creating one of the most random experiences on steam. That being said, the game is so ridiculously unoptimized that I couldn't even play the tutorial level. The basic gameplay is some kind of parkour style runner...I think? I honestly have no idea what's going on in this game at all.  https://youtu.be/w9OShDOLmFM"
1919720,0,136567857,"The bare bones of a fantastic game are here, but nothing else.  Very few characters.  Very few weapons.  No weapon evolutions.  They removed this from \"early access\" with no update, and have yet to respond to those looking for an answer as to \"why?\".  Last update was over a month ago.  Save your money."
1118110,0,136568332,"WARNING: BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS PRODUCT  so aside from the god awful vehicle physics and dreadful sound i have one big question for the devs that im betting they wont be answering, what happened to all the trains and facecutting machines that you showed us all the pictures and videos of?"

2109430,1,136568068,"Whilst not the longest game, Tron Identity is compelling from start-to-finish. I never felt choices were forced on the player, and most (if not all) felt very much in character with the bios presented to the player. If you're a fan of visual novels this will be exactly what you're expecting, and if you're a fan of anything Tron this will definitely scratch the itch. It provides some new lore for the universe, and gives players the immersion into the universe that movies and traditional media cannot through the lack of agency.Definitely recommend for a few hours more in the universe of Tron."
2109430,0,136562967,This game is designed for PSP.
2109430,1,136568003,I fight for the users.
1772830,1,136569414,"TLDR: I highly recommend Rusted Moss.************************************I was one of the games playtesters and was fortunate to see the game grow over its development cycle. I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or \"breaking\" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‘click’ with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting."
2156300,1,136567898,"1. Realistic situations2. Realistic Dialogues 3. Realistic and astounding quality rendersI just like how realistic in this game everything is, also it somehow boosted my confidence for approaching girls lol"
1498040,0,136568791,Obtuse for no reason other than to be obtuse.  A frustrating mess.
1811990,1,136569265,"Cute artstyle aside, Wildfrost is a very well put together experience and it's NOT EA!nowdays is a rare sight to buy a finished game at launch day, tho i still hope more content will be added.my latest clear team was too powerful i fear i might not be able to beat them anytime soon hahahaha A must buy for roguelike fans."
2216700,1,136568695,i actually remember seeing the developer on TikTok just last year im excited to see the game finally being released.well im looking forward to facing the challenges and hopefully completing it
1811990,1,136568995,"It's charming, challenging and very very fun. Deckbuilding done right. 10/10"
1811990,1,136569382,"Difficult, but enjoyable (so far)."
1811990,1,136568300,"Played the demo, fall in love with it. Played only a bit of base game (gonna play more when I have free time), but I right now can say this will be the game I play for coming weeks."
1811990,1,136568431,"Really nicely designed game. Feels very rogue-ey, lots of difficulty spikes and many runs needed to get deep but fun."
1811990,1,136568525,big berry my love
1811990,1,136568174,"Needs to play more of the game, but just wanna drop a positive impression to help with the review score.I love everything about this game ever since the demo, the charming as heck artstyle, the music, the depth of all play with your allies, clunker, charms, etc., that adds to the synergy.Two of my favorite deckbuilders are Slay the Spire and Vault of the Void, and I have a good feeling that Wildfrost will end up close to those two. If you love roguelite deckbuilders, this game is a no brainer."
1811990,0,136567852,"It's a neat alternative to Slay The Spire...but holy shit Poison is such a horrible mechanic and healing in this game is absurdly rare outside of your first run so you better make it count. I've had more than 10 runs in this game so far and pretty much all my deaths have been due to \"well the starting deck is dogshit so i guess i'm dying on the second fight again\"\""
1811990,1,136567848,"I already played the demo for a while and I was really, really looking forward to this game.I'm hooked on deckbuilding roguelikes ever since StP and this is one of the best I've ever played.The artstyle and the animations are gorgeous, the spins and turns on the ageing deckbuilding genre are refreshing and I can really recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a deckbuilding game and thought \"well, this is fun!\"10/10 definitely my indie game of the year so far."
307950,1,136569512,"Играю в Калибр год, за это время разрабы постоянно улучшают игру и добавляют новый контент. Классные оперативники, классные скины на них, как милитари-задрот очень оценил реалистичную снарягу и внимание к деталям. Режимы есть и для любителей понагибать в ПвП, и для любителей в коопе убивать ботов. Сейчас добавляют всё больше сюжета, новые катсцены вообще огонь.В общем, разрабам удачи, огонь, что теперь можно играть и в стиме, пацаны ваще ребята"
307950,1,136569188,"All hail NA servers! From 180 ping to 60, love it.Give it a chance, it's a grind but a fun and well worth one."
307950,1,136569393,enjoying it so far. in canada. no latency issues. game runs butter on my 1660 ti
307950,0,136569128,"I'd rather play Warface then this. Horrible design Choices: 1. The Hud is a cluster fuck 2. You have a picture as a Scope (???) 3. Unlocking Operators takes forever 4. You respawn with the same amount of ammo you had before dying (???) 5. Ammo Boxes have a 5 minute cooldown 6. You only have 3 mags and it takes almost a full one to kill someone 7. You can only use your grenade/rpg once a match 8. Pretty much pay2win with the operators since you can just buy them, one has a one shot sniper 9. Horrible voice acting 10. You cant preview any Items 11. You can only pick 1 Item from a Lootbox and Finally 12. Bad Optimisation, i get more fps playing MW 2022."
307950,1,136568966,"I have been playing this game since OBT and enjoying it ever since. The game is dynamic, has various game modes (with Frontline being my favorite) and has a great variety of operators. While being free, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win thing. I'm glad that it's finally on Steam so there's no need to use the separate launcher. All the best to the devs, you're going a great job!"
307950,1,136568944,Nice game!Loads of different characters with cool customization
307950,1,136568749,"I`ve been playing Caliber since its Beta through their own launcher. Now it`s on Steam with tons of content for new players (lucky guys) and what is more important - with new game mechanics, game modes and more. It`s not only free-to-play game, but it`s free indeed, you can play and grind, all operators can be purchased for in-game credits which are gained through playing (except the newest operators from the last battle pass, which is fine, as they become available for credits). The game process is fun, so cool to gather with friends and spend some time here. But you have to learn the mecanics, study base principles and operators perks. Glad that Caliber released on Steam to get new players and expand its community. Good luck to the team and players!"
307950,1,136568878,Fun so far
307950,1,136568674,"A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I was waiting for this game for quite some time, so i'm glad I was able to play this before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recommend to you to play this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything was done perfectly. If you read it, thank you and good bye."
307950,1,136568469,A wonderful guaranteed game worth playing. Much better and more beautiful than CS:GO or other games.
1934040,1,136571691,A decent start Pros1.graphics are amazing2.dev listens to feedback3.build your own world to your vision 4.racoonsCons1.buggy 2.not a ton of content yet3.combat feels very clunky as of now Verdict. 7.5 rating
1949030,1,136570876,"I love all the Frogwares Sherlock games! And one combined with Cthulhu is even better. I love the atmosphere and had not a single issue streaming it, so it is well balanced (no bug or crash for me).And my picture made it into the game, what an honour (kickstarter). :D Can only recommend this game!"
2109430,1,136570789,"Channels the Tron aesthetic through and through, story is good and encourages multiple playthroughs. Puzzles are fun, smart and just difficult enough.Highly recommend!"
2109430,1,136571169,Not badly writtenShort and sweetBut it’s a tron!Tron lives!
2109430,1,136571936,"Great writing, music and really strong visual presentation"
2156300,0,136569545,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.3.  This next one goes towards the \"dating sim\" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a \"b*tch, I have enough friends\" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can \"not have sex\" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely \"in progress\" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an \"ironman\" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released."
2156300,0,136571278,"EPISODE 1 is very small , many glitches are there. The story is fine but not much grabbing."
2216700,1,136571118,i never expected after defeating some bosses a number of times they actually evolve and they become tougher.love the fact that its challenging and have to create new strategies on defeating them afterwards
1811990,1,136571418,"It's difficult, but not absurdly so - if you have played card based games in the past, you need to adapt to the unique counter twist this game puts on things. But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.The runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.And if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?Give it a try. It's a great game."
1811990,1,136570370,"Accidentally killed my own leader and lost the first daily run ever, 10/10 already loving it."
1811990,1,136570950,awesome game if u like roguelike deckbuilders but fair warning this game is hard lol
1811990,1,136570249,It's got Big Berry what more could you ask for
1811990,1,136569909,game good has berry family
1811990,1,136571194,MonchMy beloved
307950,0,136570930,"(BTW I have a bit more game time than what steam shows because I merged my account to steam) I really want to like this game, but there is one particular thing about PVP that kills it for a lot of people. YOUR STAMINA DOES NOT REGENERATE AFTER ROUNDS ARE OVER. This absolutely makes no sense and they still have not got rid of it. Additionally, I am already seeing a bad sign of some cringy looking operators coming in this game. They already have one, and of course they made it a US \"operator\", that is wearing a mask and is the shit we do not need in our tactical shooter games."
307950,1,136571629,"If you like SOCOM, you might like Caliber. It's not perfect but not bad either and i'm having fun with game so that's all that matters right."
307950,1,136571104,It is pretty good
307950,0,136570882,25$ for an operator
307950,1,136570625,"Cool agents! I liked the video, it creates immersion, I really want to avenge the guys ))) Let's play!"
307950,1,136570309,A pretty chill shooter to play
307950,0,136569728,"Sinceramente, llevo desde el inicio de la beta en Europa y este juego esta años luz de ser bueno, los propios Devs lo joden con sus cambios/nerfs a cosas que no tienen ni puto sentido, de pedir mas dificultad en PvE cuando tiene al 80% de su playerbase que se caga encima y la mayor dificultad que pueden asimilar es el prologo, el PvP es la mayor mierda de cualquier juego que se pueda ver, el sistema de habilidades lo rompe por completo y lo acompaña el sistema de estamina, la mecanica de press Q to win, la skills rotas, personajes completamente desbalanceados desde hace años, la increible desync y lag que hay en PvP, los peores matchmaking que he podido ver en un PvP, el micropago del juego es entre inutil y caro para lo que da actualmente, el grindeo es muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuy lento y pesado, los battlepasses son tranquilamente lo peor en un F2P (4 battlepasses de 25 niveles) y no te devuelven lo que pagas, siendo honesto hay muchos juegos F2P mejores que Caliber. Ojo que a mi el juego me encanta pero las cosas por su nombre. Merece la pena jugarlo? Si, pero id preparados."
307950,1,136570261,"Playing for 1 yaer before steam release, pretty good and no p2w!"
307950,1,136570175,I like it for what it is...
307950,1,136569779,Cant wait to play more!!!
307950,1,136569588,"I have been playing shooters since childhood. I'm 35 and I love this game. It's hard for me to play quick reaction games. But Caliber is very balanced in this regard. Here I can try different tactics with my teammates. Well, the visual part pleases with the detailing of operatives and weapons.I wish you all good luck in Caliber!"
2363930,1,136572886,this is a must play for fans of Evil Dead. a great blend of horror and cheese
2103530,0,136573912,Not as good as melvor idle.  It does however have some multiplayer aspects that Melvor idle doesn't.  I am not a huge fan of the way they are attempting to get money out of you.  It is one thing to purchase a game and have it all unlocked.  It is another thing to offer purchases that have limited time amounts.  Overall it is meh.  Not good and not bad.
1934040,0,136573460,"At the release date this game feels like its unfinished. i have not found any outstanding bugs or irregularities in performance but after only a few hours of actual gameplay it feels really repetitive without foresight to further complexity or progression.It is fun and quite relaxing but sadly there is not enough gameplay for me to come back to the game if this is the \"Final\" version.I hope to see this game develop more and watch it become something i could spend years playing, but for now i would be bored after 10 hours of gameplay and in 13 hours i would have all the achievements."
2248580,1,136574702,"At first glance the puzzle seems simple, but your brain starts thinking like hell. It's great to come home from work and relax to nice music. Loved the art with the cat girls. The only thing they lack is animation, hopefully the developers will fix that. The well thought out story and interaction with the characters drew me into this game. I was surprised that such a simple looking game had multiple endings to choose from. This gave me the incentive to explore other story options. If you love puzzles, kittens, and all things cute, this game is definitely for you! 😻"
1409300,1,136573277,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about \"a department\" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.Story: 8/10Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, \"stay calm while disguise\" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a \"quick action button\" so we don't need to try hard anymore. Gameplay: 7,5/10The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!Graphics: 8.5/10Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. Sound: 7/10So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game arePros:+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. +Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. +There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. Cons: - Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a \"quick action button\" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. - Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.- There is no manual savingOverall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!"
2371750,1,136573988,"Must get for a fun game that you can play with all levels of focus. Fun, simple and clear path to victory. Cute animations and fun sounds. very nice."
2357670,1,136573048,"This game has original, awesome Art design and a fun concept combining interactivity and card games, skill and luck. I will definitely be playing more to get better at the mechanic and die less! The humor is a bonus, and I personally love the character drawings and facial expressions. Looking forward to unlocking the whole map!"
2357670,1,136572986,"If you're a fan of strategic gameplay and love collecting cards, then this card battler game is definitely for you! This game is a perfect combination of card collection, deck building, and tactical combat. It is very easy to pick up and play but has enough depth to encourage replays to improve your strategy.The hand-drawn artwork in this game is awesome, from the unique and varied card designs to the incredibly detailed backgrounds and interfaces. The music is fantastic and perfectly suits the action in the game. Each card has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be augmented with skills and loot, so each round requires careful consideration and strategic thinking.Overall I really enjoy Fourteen Fiends for its fun, quick gameplay and the potential for deeper strategy from different combinations of cards. Highly recommended!"
1949030,1,136574485,"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.Very excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game."
1949030,1,136573584,"Love this game! It builds upon the characters and game design of the previous game, but with a much darker atmosphere. I also personally liked that the story felt more linear and self-contained compared to the open world of Chapter One. Overall just a really solid and fun detective game!"
1919720,0,136574310,"The game released in a promising state on Early Access: The foundation was there, the gameplay loop was fun, decent spells and even if it was lacking in both content and mechanics at the time, the hints of what was upcoming was promising and would have very likely made it a great game in the genre. I don't know what happened but unfortunately the game barely received any updates during the Early access period and was left in an incomplete state that just make it hard to recommend to anyone. The Early Access tag was simply removed during release day without any content update, which means that the devs were unable to continue working on the game for any reason.I'm deeply disappointed because from all the games in the genre this was the one that perhaps I was the most excited about because I really liked the overall setting and base spells but if you are looking for a game of this type my suggestion is to play something else."
1949030,1,136572611,"Sherlock Holmes REVIEW..Pros: - Graphics remaster looks nice- Puzzles are good fun (Drove me insane)- Game play feels nice - 100% is easily  doneCons: None, I very much enjoyed this edition of the game, if anything maybe the price is a little high for a \"remaster\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XXBChnRxSg"
2109430,1,136572582,"Very amazing game, as a Tron fan but not someone big on visual novels it's absolutely everything I could ever want with new lore, great new characters that i will protect at all costs (1 in particular), and a great story. Thank you Mike and the team!!!"
1949030,1,136572813,"Short, but nice atmosphere and characters."
1772830,1,136573476,"Was lucky enough to get to playtest this game, i really love the feel of the grappling hook, i've pulled off some great shenanigans with it ^^ and i'm a sucker for a good metroidvania style game.Highly recommend!"
2216700,1,136573537,this is definitely a fresh take on the genre. Nice replay-ability
1811990,1,136575013,"Really like the game so far, and it is GORGEOUS!!!"
1811990,1,136574855,"So something interesting- While I love roguelike deckbuilders, I frequently find myself frustrated with them. Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game. I only hope I can actually strategize well enough to do well, hah."
1811990,1,136574399,"Extremely easy to learn, but challenging roguelike deck builder. It does very well to quickly get you into the game, and everything is easy to understand and play. No convolution what-so-ever. Cute art style, good music, good effects and animations.Gameplay-wise, you pick your \"hero\" card, and go on a randomly generated, mostly-linear journey and get as far as you can. Once you die, you pick a new hero and do it all over again while upgrading your town over time to provide you with new cards, items, etc.I'm not a huge fan of deck-builders or card games, but this one is definitely worth looking at and considering as it is actually a lot of fun."

1811990,1,136574168,As someone who has played a ton of roguelike/lite cardgames this game is top tier in terms of quality.I will update when I get to the point where I feel as though I'm done with the game.
1811990,1,136573711,"Hitting a few bumps but only because im still learning. Doesnt mean im not having fun with the game. The art is cute, the gameplay loop is great. Also Booshu MVP."
1811990,1,136572629,Why are you reading reviews here? Shouldn't you be playing it right now?
1811990,1,136572349,"Very in depth game, super cute art style and amazing music"
1811990,1,136574174,"Difficult, but fun."
307950,1,136574957,"Niche game, I like it ..... I miss so much Ghost Recon Phantoms and this remind me a little of him.If devs are reading pls consider to add a conquest mode, possibly a vertical map with progressive zone to capture like Ghost recon phantoms or it was called also GRO - online. And if possible more players in each team with respawn ... 8vs8 would be awesome. I wish you all the best for the game."
1934040,1,136577937,"I`m currently at day 3 so maybe its to soon to write a review but i really like this game!Its fun but there are a lot of quality of life features missing, like building structures out of the inventory (currently you have to place it in your hotbar to be able to place it). Hope theres some kind of modding support coming (will take much time in unity to setup)But other than that its a pretty good game and i hope it will get more updates soon."
1400910,1,136577501,"bought it day 1 of early access, and i can say it is 100% worth it, mainly because you get to play [spoiler]SBM[/spoiler] good job beanword of warning: please be careful with community levels, these people are [u]insane[/u]"
2349550,1,136575208,"Gifted Word: ProudI love this series (and all the other ones from Randumb) soooo~ much, every \"ending\" strikes true tho. :>The Watcher is a real cool character and I love all of the questions.Now I'm gonna try out the Fateweaver Series. <3"
1685730,1,136577403,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.It sadly felt a bit rushed.[h1]TLDR:[/h1][b]Pros:[/b][list]    [*]Charming artstyle and aesthetics    [*]Lovely OST    [*]Decently challenging puzzles    [*]Well paced gameplay    [*]Very basic character customization    [*]Collectibles offer replayability    [*]Comfortable time killer that could be finished in one sitting[/list][b]Cons:[/b][list]    [*]Minor bugs (Some already fixed, others can still be addressed)    [*]Different qualities between character models    [*]Underwhelming final Boss[/list]Overall I rate this game a 7.5/10It could have been more, but it lived up to my expectations. I definitely had fun with it and I look forward to what Catthia Games will cook up in the future."
1685730,1,136575278,"Pros:Great visual aestheticFun (but not overly complicated) puzzlesGood use of stealthCons:Couple of launch bugs (nothing game breaking and being addressed by the developer)Voice acting of the boss felt out of placePressing a button after each loading segment annoyed meOther notes:Short game - about 3-4 hours to complete.Cynthia's voice acting is fine by me, but to each their own. She is not as noticeably verbose after the initial chapter.Looks stunning at 5120x1440, but I would like a windowed mode; streaming this game (from my setup) currently would not be possible."
2227150,1,136577215,"I go by Kuri, but this aint my game lol. A sweet but short platformer, sporting 10 levels and a hub world. Movement is very fluid and it has full controller support. I would wish there was more content, but overall a fun time. All these N64 inspired platformers always tend to be extremely short, which is a shame."
1949030,0,136577967,"Very positive? Feels like bots are reviewing this.It's the 2nd worst entry after Chapter One, requiring little to no brain cells to successfully complete every mission, even on higher difficulty.There are no penalties to getting an answer wrong, because you can't really, it doesn't let you proceed with the game otherwise.That alone makes is very stupid and boring, and combined with the price tag, it's an easy no from me."
1949030,1,136577589,"It's great, but I'd really appreciate a first-person view mode like the older, pre-Chapter One games. Some clues and environmental details can be a little tough to see because a section of the camera is dedicated to the Sherlock Zone. There's a little bit of jank but considering the circumstances it was made under and the priorities of the company in those circumstances, it's totally understandable and forgivable imo."
1949030,1,136577464,"similar to sherlock chapter 1. not quite as open world (thank god). nice side stories/stuff to explore. essentially if you like the other sherlock games, you'll most likely like this one. great voice acting. nice gloomy atmophere."
1949030,1,136575832,"This game is AMAZING. The atmosphere and content is astonishing. To be honest, I was looking for more lovecraftian content, but this is good enough. Shouldn't crack the world of Sherlock after all."
2109430,1,136576231,"This is a really fun and atmospheric game. I am loving the detective elements and the puzzles. The Art style is incredible. It has drawn me into the world and I want to go back and see more Tron things. I wasn't sure I would like reading as part of gameplay, but its drawn me in along with amazing music to create an interesting and fun game. Highly recommend."
2156300,0,136575630,"While I do like the game, it has barely any content.  The choices you have to make aren't clear (would be nice if there were HINTS on each choice as to what the result is instead of GUESSING!!).  You have no control for the most part over the ONLY sex scene it has and yep, no nudity.  I mean I see the promise this game has, but way too early to release with almost no content, no control over choices (meaning no hints) and VERY expensive for a game that is bare bones.  I would tell everyone wait until there's a final product before spending that much money for this.  Yes, lots of promise -- but its only a promise.  I should have waited for the final release with patches because I am sure a lot of people want to have hints on choices, not just \"guess\" as to the best answer."
2156300,1,136575433,Finally a serious game with real characters living real lives instead of cardboard cut outs faking it through a weak plot.
1498040,1,136576438,"Very fun lil game. I'm certain there's a specific genre description for this type of gameplay, where you're just a lil dude constantly assaulted by waves upon waves of thousands of enemies & the goal is to wipe them out as efficiently as you can, but it's fun and satisfying.This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).Quite a ton of fun for the low low price. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something small to play around with between other things."

1811990,1,136578721,"Amazing art style and music! This is the first roguelike deckbuilder that I've played that has this level of polish! It's definitely a tough game, but it feels doable and is just a ton of fun!"
1811990,1,136577400,"beautiful art, polished UI and presentation, fun cards, and creative gameplay. it's good stuff."
1811990,1,136577692,I mean I bought it planning on playing one run and here I am 4 hours later. Get this game!
1811990,1,136577351,"Had been in love with this game since Demo.I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.Oh yeah, And the art is cute as hell. Probably a reason why I bought this game."
1811990,1,136576984,"I really like the game <3It looks amazing, sounds amazing, and the gameplay is fresh and fun. There is a lot to discover / challenges to beat, but the meta progression focuses on unlocking new cards, rather than making things easier, which I really like.Every roguelike deckbuilder will be compared to slay the spire, I guess, but the games feel way different. So even if you don't like StS, I think its worth giving a shot"
1811990,1,136576929,"One run in right now but I played the demo a lot before release.This game SLAPS, it is amazing. Don't bother reading other reviews, try it now if you're into deckbuilders like Spire or Monster Train.Great art, catchy music, fun monster designs. The gameplay is easy to pick up and learn but difficult to master. Very fast paced for a deckbuilder once you get the swing of things as well I think."
1811990,1,136577346,I like it.
1811990,1,136576819,"It is difficult, cute, fun and satisfying. Buy it, play it, review it. It deserves your attention if you like these types of games, or just roguelikes in general.Also, the game isn't as hard as people say it is. I am horrible at these types of games and I got a win in the first 5 hours. You slowly learn what it is cool and what isn't, what is useful and which enemies are difficult."
307950,1,136577806,"PSA: Must play for SOCOM fans.I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the \"mobile game\" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with \"story\" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress."
307950,1,136577646,"Been playing this game since the Closed Beta in 2020.Nice gunplay, fluid movement system. Sometimes slow, sometimes hectic gameplay.You could say it's a bit grindy from time to time, but there is no P2W and AFAIK, no overpowered unlocks.Patience, using cover and teamplay are the most important things."

307950,1,136576739,Excellent game!
307950,0,136576275,"As someone who played this game from close Beta all I can say is stay away.After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing \" How would i feel if someone tbagged me\" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.Whoever defends 1C with [pre or after wargaming era] is basically just sucking up to the devs, hoping for something, or is  literally coping. If you have money and time you may have fun, but nothing on the long run."
307950,0,136575701,This might be a free-to-play game but everything in the shop is overpriced. I'll consider re-reviewing the game if devs add acceptable regional pricing.
307950,1,136576268,It reminds me SOCOM but with micro-transaction
2198070,0,136578512,"Game seems horribly unbalanced. The resource generation is almost non-existent while every other card is either a road or require 10 of a resource which you just lost due to not seeing a resource generation card in 5-10 turns.oh wait, there goes a random event and you lose 1 of each resource now and lose. again.Tried clicking the feedback button and was just taken to their socials links.Not sure leaving a comment on their Youtube page will help any.The game is unique and enjoyable, after i turned the music down a bit. because it is nice and calm but them BAM TRUMPETS AND HORNS AND then it is calm and quiet again."

2198070,1,136577833,"I love this game, it is charming, it's got beautiful graphics, it has cookie you can bite I love it. It is not too in-depth like many other building games, you don't have to study through long youtube videos like many other building games but at the same time it is challenging because of the luck element. I'm in love with this game, I definitely recommend it."
2198070,1,136576244,"Graphics are awesome. The probability that cards that may be needed at that moment will come out of the deck should be increased. It's a game made by beginners. Accordingly, it's a pretty good game."

1527950,1,136581838,"Wartales is an impressive game that took me by surprise. I found myself sinking more than 110 hours into it without even noticing how much time had passed. One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.Overall, Wartales is a fantastic game that offers a rich and satisfying experience. Its unique features and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of strategy and RPG games."
1527950,1,136580888,"super fun so far. movement around the map could definitely be improved. if you click on a spot for your party to go, they try to go in a straight line, and almost always get caught on terrain. other that that, i'm absolutely loving it. the freedom to do what you want, party management, camp building...all fantastic so far. if you like the idea of medieval x-com type gameplay, definitely give this a try."
2194400,1,130409958,"A great game, its so fun"

1527950,1,136580469,Good game. Congrats on the release!
1527950,1,136579900,Great game!
1527950,1,136578763,"Similar to Battle Brothers with similar yet different mechanics and graphics, enough that i would say the game feels different while being of the same genre. I would say this game is slightly easier at the moment especially since BB has monsters that can woop you if you are not careful, developer seems to be trying to make game harder tough which sounds dope. I honestly don't have any bad things to say about the game so far its got a good combo going between the management and fighting aspects. 9/10 would buy again"
1527950,1,136577069,"Excellent RPG game with management elements. Some mechanics may be difficult to understand at first, but they become clear as you progress through the game. The graphics are excellent, and I'm currently playing it in co-op with just one other person, which makes managing the camp and characters a bit easier."
1527950,1,136577595,This game expertly manages RPG/Exploration/Character-building and is continually improving. The Devs are open to ideas and interact with the community.
1527950,0,136576847,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best \"tactical RPG\" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are \"distributed evenly\" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While \"unfair\" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it \"accessible for wider audience\" or something - just another game.UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work."
1527950,1,135994634,"A good game, similar to Battle Brothers but definitely doing its own thing."
1527950,1,135945975,"I really like this game. It isn't really like any other game I have and which adds to its charm. It is lite Role Playing  and has some nice puzzle sections that I actually enjoy. The Combat is really enjoyable, I prefer the turn based style and building up your gang is fun. I am looking forward to another play through on full release, which I think is in the next week or so."
1527950,1,135983560,"The game play is fun and dynamic. Exactly what you want out of a turn based combat, resource management game"
1527950,1,135965491,your mom
1527950,1,135994422,nice
1527950,1,135942059,"Turn based RPG with layers of features. Great available classes and build variations. Amazing survival mechanics. Many types of mission/quest that does not repetitive much. Good graphics although I hope there would be more kill animation. Multiple hours of fun. However, the game is too quiet for my taste, no voice acting, but not a big deal. Limited character customization but armors and weapons are design beautifully which is fun.This game have the potential to expand into and epic game.Overall :  8.1Graphics : 8.0Story : 7.0Combat : 9.0Survival : 8.5Replayability : 8.0"

1527950,1,135929503,Do you like sending bears into combat to maul your enemies?Capturing a zombie and making him a loyal bard?Feasting on wolf sausage and sardines?Well if so...THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

1527950,1,135926112,"Playing Wartales brings back memories of my childhood spent playing Might and Magic III. Since then, I haven't found a turn-based RPG that I enjoyed until I discovered Wartales a few months ago through YouTube videos. It's a fantastic modern successor to the Turn based RPG games from my childhood, and I absolutely love it.The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat. Playing in open GL mode reduces the problem, but I hope the developers add the Nvidia optimization to solve this issue.Despite this issue, I highly recommend this game at its full price, and it's worth every penny. Don't wait for a sale; get it now."
1527950,0,133339053,Game is frustrating. Grind is ridiculous. Loot is penurious. You spend most of your gold paying wages and buying food. This game is horrible

1527950,1,133315877,"A fantastic game even in Early Access.Plenty of content to keep you engaged, with over 100 locations to discover and more coming when V1.0 arrives. There's a little arena, tons of quests, little 'bosses' you can fight that once killed, drops unique and upgradable weapons, Bounties to fulfil, relationships between your companions, even arguments. Co-op is also an option if you're into that.The game keeps getting better and better every single update and it keeps me coming back to it.The only negative thing I can actually say about it is the fact that I can't decapitate people. Why am I allowed to whip my little slave men but I can't execute them.An absolutely fantastic game overall and I recommend it for people who enjoy tactical, turn-based RPGs."
1527950,1,133316502,Fun RPG turn-based game.  Developers have continued adding to the game and it gets better with every update.
1527950,1,133309565,"I found it brutally hard, and couldn't save when i wanted to, but so addicting.. Love it"

I havent played it as much as I would like(tooo many other story games im playing) but i do check out the game every now and then and its always a fun challenge. every single update no mater how small or big it is, has been a huge in making the most ideal adventure for you. loving everything"
1527950,1,133303935,One of the best RPG games ever!
1527950,1,133292009,"Really has potential. Really into the concept.There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play."
1527950,1,130199030,"Decent. Grab during a sale.The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again. It's overpriced at $30, and I'd encourage nearly everyone to play Battle Brother instead, but it's worth a look if you can grab it during a sale."
1527950,1,130188531,Would I recommend Wartales...100%  Yes.Its like a D&D table top
1527950,1,130201876,Addicted
1527950,0,130154072,"Instead of devoting all time and resources to f' ing FINISHING the game, bringing-in quality-of-life fixes, FIXING THE INCREDIBLY-BROKEN PROFESSIONS, ESPECIALLY ANGLER AND SCHOLAR, and on and on and on, the development-team believes that it is more important to focus on co-op/multi-player, in a game that is entirely-designed as a single-player-game.This level-of-incompetence is, to me, unbelievable, and is what leveraged-my-decision to refund this not-very-fun game, which I probably would have done even if there was not this elephant-in-the-room issue of development-incompetence and poor direction."
1527950,1,130186860,i came into this thinking it would be a clone of Battle Brothers they do share a lot of similarity's butThis has a soul of it's own i could and will sink a lot of hours into this. I would Recommend this to any fans of Strategy RPG's It's great solo and Co-op.
1527950,1,130149997,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a \"low\" fantasy world, this seems to be a \"lower\" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the \"nine-lives\" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. \"Healed\", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a \"rogue\" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a \"ranger\", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same."
1527950,1,130143807,"this is a hidden Gem! very good so far. it is essentially a top down rpg, you do have a party but move all as one unit on the map with shared inventory so you dont have to swap between inventories of party members. the world is explored top down crpg like diablo or Wasteland and when combat is engaged it plays turn based akin to divinity with cool kill animations, and some environmental things. its got a pretty in depth crafting system and each character can have a profession they can skill up at and craft better stuff. there is also fun mini games like fishing and armor crafting and based on performance in mini game is the quality of item. it does have difficulty scaling so you can customize it to meet the level you find fun both on survival and combat elements.  party management does not feel like a chore as you find contracts to get paid to pay your merc party and can find food in wild/ hunting fishing gathering. also you can find crafting materials in world for crafting gear and cooking food. camping is fun and intuitive. all in all im having a blast and i wish i picked it up sooner. if you like the idea of a free roam top down crpg with crafting and good turn based combat that is simple yet fun this could be your new best friend. have not ran into any stability issues yet and only one small bug that was not a hindrance in any way."
1527950,1,130153060,Yes
1527950,1,130126158,"Wartales is a fun and challenging game for you or you and a friend to play. (Thanks to Co-Op) It is a true gem and I highly recommend you support this game and project. It combines RTS, RPG, Open world, and makes you think."
1527950,0,130132792,Not enough content to be worth buying at the moment
1527950,1,127064312,"Loving it so far, just got it and played it for a few hours. For a pre-release I'm impressed and not going to complain. Hope to see more from these folks."
1527950,1,127077206,Great game.
1527950,1,127031534,this game so addict event EA it still greatwhat need to improve ai right is really EA they only have one skill to use per turn compare to player which can use 1- 3 skill but it early access rightlate game when you have all of gold food it start to get bored. should have some dynamic event to make game look challenge
1527950,1,127019462,Very tactical game!
1527950,0,126967397,"There seems to be a trend going on of games that are deemed good because they are difficult. It started with Dark Souls and everyone seems to be trying it. However the difficulty of DS is self scalable and a tone setter for the game. Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...Number of points.1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive."
1527950,1,126981315,Good game and different difficulties makes it enjoyable even if you are really bad/good at this kind of game.
1527950,0,126962193,After playing a while gets very dull and boring.
1527950,0,126902464,"I really really like the game but most of the time you spend running back and forth, back and forth trying to get money or food to just feed your folks... I want to play to darn game but never really can because it is all about food and gold nothing else.  I understand that the gold/food is a core feature but dear lord dial it back a little bit.  I have all unlocks for gold reduction, food reduction, and repair reduction yet I ALWAYS run out of gold or food... I only have 4 companions and 2 beasts to try to keep the food consumption down but it is non-stop annoying that you are constantly running out of food, never have enough gold to buy anything from vendors really so only option is to steal and then you spend the time running from patrols.  As it sits only more hardcore players will ever play the game, dial it back slightly and you might get some additional players."
1527950,1,126933346,"Absolutely fantastic. Great mix of story, exploration, and turn-based combat. I am so hooked."
1527950,1,126891655,it's good
1527950,1,122949103,"If you like Battle Brothers, this one is similar (though not quite so hard). There is none of the RNG that can ruin your evening like in BB. The game is pretty and I've enjoyed the setting, too."
1527950,1,122943146,hyhhhhhhhhhhh
1527950,1,122930611,"Excellent game.  Tons of fun, I love the pacing and self directed adventure.  No artificial pressure or race against the clock.  It's nice to relax, explore and go on adventures.The character customization, traits, relationships and growth are a big part of the fun.I get genuinely attached to my mercenaries and feel it when they die.For Gold!  For Glory!"
1527950,1,122931993,very professional and funny game. i like it most. thank you for your effort. waiting for all of this new thing impatiently.

1527950,1,122889356,"Brilliant game and to think that it's still in early access. Great tactical turn based fights, with various party dynamics. Lots of different tasks in different areas with plenty of options open to layers. Great concept and great game."
1527950,1,122909076,"Captivating game. Didn't encounter many bugs.Feels almost complete, almost. They need to fine polish some of the components like menus and such. Nothing game breaking tho.Love it!"

1527950,0,119502070,Wish I got paid every 3 days.
1527950,1,119492306,"This game is AMAZING. It's a Early Access game yet, but for anyone that enjoys slow paced mercenary group kind of game (yes, if you like Battle Brothers you'll probably love this) this is a GEM. 60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!You like Battle Brothers? Go for it. Absolutely no brainer."
1527950,1,119501715,"Rich and beautiful tactical game with lot of creativity in making the character builds. Word of warning, though - very addictive game!"
1527950,1,119501351,A fun and entertaining game
1527950,1,119490523,"Love this. Miniature medieval villages, rolling hills and a tiny army of weary soldiers fighting against the odds. What's not to love??"

1527950,0,119482055,"This game was fun but I stopped after 30+hrs until they finished it before playing more.  After latest update, the game does not load and no response from developer."
1527950,1,119481589,XCOM but better
1527950,1,116441050,"A great game but for the lingering bugs.Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.Wartales is very promising and I keep coming back to it (avoiding marketplaces as much as possible) despite the ongoing problems.  Once those are sorted out and the game is refined further, I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of my favorites."
1527950,1,116433916,"An in-depth fun, challenging, and well executed Squad based tactics RPG. Wartales absolutely nails what it's going for and I'm glad to be along for the ride."

1527950,1,116377748,awesome game
1527950,1,114049736,"Early access titles are usually hit or miss, and Wartales was definitely a hit.It's the classic formula of \"build up a group of mercenaries\", where you do quests, earn money, recruit more mercs and make them stronger, then use that to complete harder quests. Other games that I'd compare it to are Battle Brothers and Mount&Blade.It's not quite finished yet, and this is especially noticeable in UI/UX, some content, and balancing. However, the core systems are all there and really fun. Research and crafting is really cool, and the various progress systems (Comprendium, research, ...) are amazing in a game of this genre. Haven't encountered any bugs or crashes either. Would definitely recommend to everyone who's into turn-based combat :)"
1527950,0,114103431,"Fun, but has a few fatal flaws for me.  NPC AI is awful - they charge headlong into combat and use no tactics whatsoever; no ability to swivel camera (or if there is, they haven't mapped it out for the player); no way to re-read quests.  Not sure what the backstory is either.   needs a little work still."
1527950,1,114112026,Really love this game. Wish it could have a feature to x1.5 to x2 speed in world map

Has some pretty interesting elements, however being still in early access there isn't a great deal to do in the world. personally i think the battle caps can be a bit too big, it can be a real grind when youre fighting 20 wolves and you have 20 party members etc, these battles can take half an hour and happen quite frequently after a few hours gameplay. it also means there is no real attachment to any of the characters in your band and as such, whilst there are some good foundations laid the gameplay all ends up feeling rather insipid. dont pay more than 30 dollarydoos until some major updates happen."
1527950,1,114031880,"I am not a fan of \"early access\" titles or in any way encouraging developers utilizing that payment model.  Wartales however is a very well polished game.  IMO this game is Mount and Blade but instead of first persons shooter for combat, it is turn-based.  If that peaks your interest, you will enjoy this game."
1527950,1,114047586,I'm glad I bought this game. It's tough and grim. Once the learning curve is overcome there's a lot to like if you're into Turn Based Combat. Very excited to see it develop.
1527950,1,114048357,"Absolutely loving this game. Resource management, turned based strategy, crafting etc... amazing game."
1527950,0,114030337,"running a \"new-ish\" rtx 590 build. literally randomly crashes. when it does it bricks my graphics drivers and i have to reinstall from scratch. how the F&$% does this happen?!?Wish it worked, bc it was pretty fun."
1527950,1,114015665,I'm so excited for the Multiplayer update! Great game!
1527950,0,112814994,"Its a challenge. alot of the time during turn based combat, u get 1 attack when the enemy gets 3. then they get twice as many turns as you. enjoy!"
1527950,0,112787787,"I love the idea of Wartales, but for a tactical battle RPG to be fun, the combat has to be fun, and I found it fiddly, slow and grindy. Add on top of that even fiddlier town and quest mechanics, and what you're left with is a much prettier, but much less fun version of Battle Brothers."
1527950,1,112786140,"Got the game today, i have done nothing productive all day aside from starting 3 new games to get the best party going and begin to slay everything in sight under the guise of justice. Would recommend"
1527950,1,112782729,Pretty fun.It's like Battle Brothers with better graphics and UI...and also without the unforgiving/ridiculous difficulty.
1527950,1,112791423,Good stuff worth the price tag i picked it up in a sale for 23 quid...
1527950,1,112782518,If you enjoy playing games that force you to be tacticful and have to avoid fights and take real consquences for taking risking fights. then you will enjoy this game. its just hard enough to make you struggle but not enough to overwelm you
1527950,1,112777848,"Great game and wonderful concept, I am waiting it become better and having more career and development paths."
1527950,1,112776733,"Could be an interesting game. Combat is fun and interesting.But it's too frustrating to play until they improve the save game system. You can only have one save game per run and auto-saves are not reliable since there's no telling when it's being done. The ability to have more than one save per play-through as well as auto-saves for beginning of last combat and last entrance to town would be nice.Uninstalling and will wait a year to see how it improves.Edit: Reinstalled to try the different save game setting called \"Free\" and is a lot more helpful than the default setting. Would be nice to have a Quick Save option with the \"Free save\" option like many other games that gives the save game names by the relative position in the world or something."
1527950,1,112773148,"More people gotta get this game because its incredibly well made.Developers, take some notes from Kenshi, I'd wager a lot of gameplay elements from that game will fit perfectly in this game."
1527950,1,112775536,"really have been enjoying the game good combat, progression system, quests i also like the point and click searching for items and loot in area's"
1527950,1,109836280,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  42hrs in the first area alone.  I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like \"Wartales\" feels like a \"Play the way you want to with the backstory you want\" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a \"MEH\" for now.Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?"
1527950,1,109862139,"Developers that are listening to their players!!! Well I never :DHope that game will be finished soon, but even in an early access is a good one."
1527950,1,109866328,fun game
1527950,1,109828559,"Entertaining.  Gets compared to Battle Brothers, but it is only that in the idea that you are a mercenary band.  Combats are a bit slower, but give more/different options.  The map is great, the stories are great, the combat is good, and the troop management is good.  Lots and lots of variety in builds and capabilities of different weapons.  Each region has an underlying story and decisions you can make to find your spot in the world.There are still a few rough edges (it is Early Access), but I haven't noticed any bugs and it is still pretty darn fun."

1527950,1,109833001,sexy game
1527950,1,109814963,"The game is hard but its alot of fun, maybe get more tutorials on classes and the fact that the player can choose what fighter goes first. Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more \" DND \" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill \"and/or dice\" if you decide to implement that in the game.Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch \"preperation hint\" was good :) All in all, thats my look at the game so far, i like it and i hope it has a bright future :)"
1527950,1,109824597,"Very addictive indeed, recommend for people who likes to build your own army in a anyway open world"
1527950,1,109791389,"This is an uncut Gem a little bit of polishing and would make it a Great game, worth buying if into this genre and the Devs are active with patching."
1527950,1,109790869,I see a lot of potential in this game :O!Keep up the good work devs!As of now 9/10
1527950,1,107265372,"so this is one of those games that you will restart 3 or 4 timesthere are so many parts of this game that are not explained you have to learn as you play... hence the reason to restart so many timesbut........... after you finally get how to play and keep your gear, weight, food and everything else in check, you will find yourself still playing at 5 oclock in the morninga massive fun game still in EA and if the devs keep up the good work, this game will be an epic classic foreverI love it and I would type more about this game but my team of warriors are waiting for me and we have to get back to the adventuretwo huge thumbs up"
1527950,1,107251158,"Wartales really scratches an itch for turn based RPG combat.  It's still Early Access, so some features are still being added or tweaked, but I think the core gameplay is solid enough to justify the price.  Art direction looks great, the combat is satisfying and mostly intuitive, and the setting feels alive and interesting."
1527950,1,107266367,Reminds me of Darklands
1527950,1,107194722,"I buy a few new games this time of year, the sales, but this one deserves mention. It's stand out in many ways, it's a survival sim, as well as very immersive RPG. You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive? I have yet encounter any real bugs, though sometime I think i have, you can only sell bandits as prisoners...not the innocent folks you bash over the head and force into slavery because you are to cheap to buy another pony....but you will have to feed them. It's deep, and the turn based combat is too, like chess, skill and fore thought are required. in short BUY IT, best new game of the season. The only thing lacking is more provinces, and PvP, there is already an arena you can fight NPCs in so really hoping that becomes a PvP thing...with a full loot option of course, maybe even some Pvp provinces? Who knows? These devs have proven they can deliver what we want, the newest \"happiness patch\" makes the games so much better right off, that was direct and quick response to player feed back."
1527950,1,107184003,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD SO FAR. Great squad mechanics and though the combat does feel grueling at some points its never 'annoyingly slow' (might b nice to have the option to skip enemy combat animations and/or allied ones). Trade system is good, the difficulty of enemies with leveling is nice as I've had companions die but it has been nowhere near a common occurence (on Normal difficulty). Quests are fun, storylines are exciting, I'm vaguely addicted to how fun this game has been and... -- I'm excited to see all this game can/will hold"
1527950,1,107208016,"Really good concept and it plays very well with few crashes, basically a combination of m&b warband, Dragon age origins and XCOM. Very reminiscent of D&D 5e..."
1527950,1,107188143,10/10 FANTASTIC GAME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FIRST COUPLE OF PEOPLE YOU LOSE AND KEEP ON TRUCKING
1527950,1,107179864,Great game for people that like strategy. Cannot wait until full release!
1527950,1,107169750,great game cant wait to see what they do during the rest of development
1527950,1,107159985,"Awesome game, recommend!"
1527950,0,105782346,"BLUF: too expensive for what is offering right now, Will come back to this review once there are enough updates to have mid and late game content.EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsupIt's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it’s a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can’t use axes… seriously?).The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn’t explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it’s repetitive and boring.Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that’s worth 35 € EA for you… But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore."
1527950,1,105782696,Great game if you like such games. :)) Hope to see nice updates!
1527950,1,105779953,hard as hell but alot of fun
1527950,1,105777625,Great game with lots of small gameplay components that you might not notice right off the bat.  The only drawback is the current max level which stops at 5.  I just wish they would at least let you keep levelling even though you wouldn't have access to the perks.  It feels weird to keep playing through 2 other regions when you're not getting any progress on your character.
1527950,1,105776012,battle brothers but better. the happiness system needs work but other than that its a ton of fun
1527950,1,105777954,I love this game and I'm really excited for upcoming contents :D Price is worth the game
1527950,1,105779645,Enemy NPC match with player lvl is suck. Plz change it
1527950,1,105762580,"Truly and amazing Early Access - i just wished I knew i will sink so much into this game, haven't played so much for more than 10 years and now I`m afraid I finished it. Hard to explain, because if you look at this, the graphs are quite bad, the story itself is very rudimentary, mechanics not truly amazing - so all these characteristics that other games have more or less. And still this game is soo amazing overall, hard to explain. I just hope they don't polish it too much. Big thumps up."
1527950,1,105770593,"Amazing game, cant recommend it enough. Its perfect for a late evening gaming session"
1527950,1,105763584,has a building and work

1527950,1,105373058,"I don't often write a review but this game deserves recognition.Superb game, even in early access. So much to do with so many combinations to play with. I've only played being a noble group of mercenaries, doing contracts etc, everything from killing bandits to finding items and it can be totally unforgiving if your not careful. You have the option to play it safe or get stuck in to the heavy opponents, just make sure your geared for it haha. It's also clear that you can choose to be a sneaky group of bandits a pray on unsuspecting caravans etc. Love it. Well done.Can't wait to see what content you bring out for this."
1527950,1,105373284,"A really solid base of a game, looking forward to what more they add to it. I'm hoping for more class options, and more classes in general."

1527950,1,105373223,"Really great game, the only thing I'd like to see is a voice pack."
1527950,1,105371598,"Early Access but already a classic. Immersive graphics and fun mechanics. You fall in love with your team.... but surviving and keeping them alive & happy is no easy feat. Mount & Blade meets Battle Brothers. Clean, crisp, can't stop.  The more I play the more I fall in love with this game. This is now one of the top 5 games in my library. Simply superb! Bring on more content please."
1527950,1,105370988,"Incredible Game, literally can't get enough of it. Lovingly crafted - intricate and tragic stories to experience. Still a few bugs to work out - and would love some customization (e.g. some way to refresh recruits - get skills in the beginning). Loving it so far."
1527950,1,105062650,"Very fun to play this game , many quest , many thing to do , very deep play style"
1527950,1,105064574,It's like Battle Brothers but if Battle Brothers wasn't dog shit
1527950,1,105064702,Strongly recommended! You'll have fun playing this.
1527950,1,105064131,just the game i was looking for.
1527950,1,105062716,Nice
1527950,1,105060358,"Looking for an alternative to battle brothers? You found it!I will say combat in this is worse than in battle brothers, but that might change in the future. I have played the demo before early access and things have changed for the better already so I am confident they can find a way to make this game even better than it already is.EDIT: After going back to some Battle Brothers...Wartales has better combat imo. Cause it has no RNG. After such a long time of gaming and having played mainly chivalry and mordhau the last years I just can't stand these RNG systems anymore. So if you are annoyed at the RNG of battle brothers (ala XCOM) then you can safely get Wartales."
1527950,1,105060650,"its a good gameits a sandbox mercenary group game with turn based combatits fun and exciting and has a lot of potential for those who like the genrecombat animation are cool and skills are interestingcombat feels like your trying to solve a puzzlei think i could sink a lot more hours into thisPrice could be cheaperif your a fan of battle brothers \"auto buy\" but do consider the price tag for the time beingApproved for an early access game"
1527950,1,105060764,"A game with huge potential which is also very fun in the current state. It is obviously not a very big prio, but this game could use some optimization and QoL things to make things smoother, but I'm sure it will come with time.Even in the current state (early access just released) I can wholeheartedly recommend it."
1527950,1,105060687,"Wartales is a really good game amazing art style, as i go on the game only gets better. Would defiantly suggest getting this game."
1527950,1,105060144,"Amazing game, great graphics and gameplay. The first hour can be really hard but once you get it it's really satisfying!"
