1934040,1,136513114,"This is the only game I'm willing to play all day long. Good graphics with interesting gameplay and it all works on a weak computer - it's awesome.Of the good things to note are. Comfortable camera Interesting-big game world Lots of mobs Fascinating game with lots of biomesNo computer requirements On the downside. There is only one minus that I could find- Stupid mobs while fighting them, you can easily hide from them In conclusion, we can say that this is a great project, which is actively developing with good support from the developers"
2334560,0,136513050,"The concept and art are fine, but the game's mechanics and other design decisions prevent it from being enjoyable to play. The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it‚Äôs highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don‚Äôt want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow."
1400910,1,136514066,"Waited for 1.0 to drop to put this out finally.This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)Overall If you're really into bullet hell, this game is a must have. It's really fun and its tracks are absolute bangers."
2248580,1,136512233,"OMG, this game is sooo cute and fun! üòç I love finding the cats and turning them back into catgirls. They are all so adorable and sweet. The puzzles are easy but not boring, and the music is relaxing and soothing. I feel like I‚Äôm in a kawaii paradise when I play this game. üíïThe best part is that there are so many catgirls to choose from, and they all have different personalities and styles. I can‚Äôt decide which one is my favorite. Maybe the pink one with the glasses, or the blue one with the bow. They are all so purrfect! üòªThis game is a must-play for anyone who loves cats, anime, or just cute things in general. It will make you smile and melt your heart. I give it 5 stars and two paws up! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüêæüêæ"
2364250,1,136512230,"It's like a tough and unfair life, where we start with a small store and a small budget to develop to a large chain of stores."
1409300,0,136513866,"This game supposed to be fun, but there was this moment when I move my MC Setyo the game got stuck or choppy or laggy or whatever it is.I hope the other players who got excited over this game didn't share the same experience as I do.Please, optimized the game, thank you."
1729900,1,135237351,"[h1]Before I played Rhythm Brawl, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
1729900,1,122580797,"cool, has potential but i think the drawings should be done before anything else."
1729900,1,125559837,ms paint rhythm my belowed
1729900,0,121230865,"Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game."
1729900,1,121311975,I get more points than NPC and still lose what wrong with game.
1729900,0,118681190,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel \"art\".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling \"art\") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards."
1729900,0,119682629,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game."
1729900,1,116989907,"Hey. It's really good. Songs are good, Gameplay is alright. This is pretty good!"
1729900,1,114308657,"Although I found some satisfaction in the game, the gameplay isn't very diverse. Jumps and jacks are the only patterns I've seen. Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at. I think this is a good start for this type of game and its concept."
1729900,1,115583159,"When I first played this game, it was hardly playable. So I just uninstalled it. However, after a long hiatus and re-installing the game. I have to say, I'm looking forward to the finished product! They've come a long way."
1729900,1,116734222,Its not finished yet but honestly it has great potential and could become a big game

2364250,1,136514533,A cool game in which you have to make your own supermarket. Of the pluses is the fact that money is accumulated even if you do not enter the game. I love clickers and this game is no exception. I recommend
2349550,1,136514247,IS quite interesting even for a second one. while a lot deeper than the first can give you time to reflect back upon yourself.secret word: strength.combine word : garden strength.
1685730,1,136515152,"Wery good game:Pros:- story- landscape- puzzles (very good)I can recommend it, with hope for more games like that."
2227150,1,136514584,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration. I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)good+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. + The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.neutral= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. bad (these are really really minor issues)- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.------ Level Times01 - 00:58:80202 - 00:51:56603 - 00:48:94904 - 00:51:48505 - 00:55:51306 - 00:54:91407 - 00:41:24808 - 00:41:32009 - 00:58:07310 - 00:48:492"
2103530,1,136517189,"A very awesome game, even though some (not all) concepts are similar to Melvor Idle which I don't mind, I like the these type of idle based html/web like based games."

2151770,1,136518027,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don‚Äôt work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn‚Äôt there because you simply can‚Äôt afford a better gun at the start. The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each \"floor\" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there‚Äôs enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter."
