It's a small developing team not a Triple A title, there are going to be bugs.  If you want a near perfect game go buy a $70 title at GameStop not a $12 game on Steam. The bugs are minor, the development team is releasing patches and fixing them as they are found so that isn't the issue.  The game is fun if you like games like Gold Miner or Out of Ore where you are performing mindless repetitive tasks like removing dirt and selling it to buy new equipment. The problem is the actual mining takes little to no effort so it is incredibly easy to buy everything the game has to offer in one play session leaving you virtually nothing to do after.  I can only hope the dev team has much more in store for DLC to increase replay value. There in game store contained a train in the demo that is not there in the finished game so there's hope they have more in store."
1949030,1,136633163,"Hello, this is the Man of Chaos speaking!Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is now officially live past two days. As a fan of past Frogwares games, even tho I am getting into some older ones in recent times, I liked the games I have played.It was one of the main things I have decided to back the game on kickstarter one year ago, or how long it was already, the time passes by so quickly.Quick disclaimer: I have not played the original game, or the remaster of it. Wanted to finish this remake of a game and now I shall play older ones, since I wanted to play this one blind.So, how did the game go? It is not an open world, neither it is not that narrow as one would expect. Played the game with Premium edition which includes small sidecases, which I deemed interesting, even tho they are nothing that ground breaking, since it is not the main focus of the game. Also by completing those, you acquire costumes, which in one half of a game you can wear, on the other half you have clothes limited because of the plot reasons, on the other hand, when you get to those, you have a lot to choose from, for Sherlock and for Watson. I had fun and I believe you will have too.For the main story, we have seven episodes, each getting you somewhere else with like two minor exceptions, which I will not speak of, as it might compromise the story a little bit. Nonetheless, they are nice locations to go through and I enjoyed every single one. As it is more linear style of game than previous Chapter One, there are those sidequests and the main plot, yet at some places it feels like there is not much, in another time it feels like there is a lot things at a spot. When it comes to difficulty settings, I do not know how much of a difference there is, since I ran it on the hardest difficulty. Difficulty has its toggles and you can enable and disable things as much as you like. At some parts, I had to make a toggle two times because of a reconstuction of a crime that took place, and I had no idea what I have done wrong. On the hardest difficulty you will see that you have done something wrong, but if you lower the difficulty, you can see exactly which ones does not fit the narrative so you can move past the sequence, because mainly it gives information which you use into other informations to know what to do, or where to go next. At some places I have run into a difficulty of finding some things which were there, and was looking for them for some time before I actually stumbled upon them. The game does offer you a radar saying what you can interactive with, but it seems to highlight things in an area where you stand or what you can interact near the spot, hard to tell how it works. Just be aware that some things can be missed, although you will get to it eventually since it might be a part of the crime scene where you need all elements anyway. Connecting information to know where to go next or how to deal with an important situations? We have that as well, in another variant of mind palace! I had run into some things being a trial and error, because you never know, if you have already enough information for it to click or not, or when you know what you are looking for, it might take some other information to select than what you would think, even tho after making it the way the game wants, you kinda get it as well.Story wise? Do not come looking for Chapter One or Crimes & Punishments, since its little of both. Mainly, it is a continuation of Chapter One, which was a reboot of Sherlock Holmes. This is what follows Chapter One. I had a lot of fun, mainly since I knew nothing of the previous games that this is based upon. Game has some horror aspects, mainly to the name of Lovecrafts. Those scenes are not there that often when thinking over the game, but they aren't there nor redundant or something that would hinder the game. At a part of the game I felt disgusted, because I do not take some things that easily, even tho there is nothing really appaling. Story in a lenght is like 9-10 hours, last (my nearly 11th hour) I hunted few achievments that I missed. On the other hand, I have loved the game, even when some would consider it short. The game takes you in shoes of Sherlock Holmes and Watson really well and I am grateful for it. Also the game has a lot of refferences and I loved to see them, if you played other Sherlock games, you might find them as well ^^I regret nothing, liked the game from start to the end. The side cases, the places you went to visit, all the emotions, puzzles, all of it. You can go through the game as you like, since thanks to difficulty settings you can play at your own tempo, at your own terms. I do recommend this game, as much as all those games I have played by Frogwares so far! I am looking for another release by Frogwares, already feeling stoked what comes next. Approved by the Man of Chaos."

2109430,0,136633728,why do you have to put pronoun bullshit in my tron game? refunded
1811990,0,136635511,"first steam review for a disgusting dev team with NO RESPECT to player feedback.not a newbie, i've played at least 50+ roguelike/lite games since the binding of issac; dead cells, splunky, slay the spires, monster trains, u name it.i agree with most bad reviews: the difficulty curve of this game sxxks, just because of bad game balance design. and guess what? the dev announce that \"we've noticed a large amount of bad reviews from chinese-language players and .......... here's some tips for ya. blahblahblah.\"rediculous. unbelievable. with no respect to people who expect to play your game and wait for such a long time. at least you can say \"we will carefully re-consider the difficulty design, perhaps add an easy mode (take the current version as the normal mode) in the future.\"and no. fxxk u. feel so stupid to trust u and pay u."
1772830,1,136633228,"Played a couple hours of the Steam NextFest demo which sold me on the game (and even carried my save game over! though I'll need to replay start for achieves probably).If you're on the fence I recommend just buying and playing it a bit, the bungee grapple will probably take a while for me to master, but within the 2 hour refund window you should be able to discern if it's the kind of thing you want to figure out or if it doesn't jive with you.Shame there's no longer a demo, not sure I would've got it otherwise, or at least as quickly. I know Ultrakill is something I immediately hopped on after playing the demo, where I might've waited a bit longer after it got more hyped up to get it, but I think if you like what you see with the Rusted Moss gameplay, you'll probably have fun if you can clear the difficulty floor of the bungee."
1811990,1,136635517,Adventure Time animation mixed with best roguelike deckbuilders and you have this little gem. One of the best in my collection for sure.
1811990,0,136635207,"So... Fuck this a hard one to write because while I do love so many many aspects of this game, and probably will keep playing it. I do get why it's getting a mixed score. Usually, I don't write reviews but for card games in particular I feel like I have enough experience to properly rate them somewhat.Do I think the game is a horrible mess? No. Do I think it's as good as the genre mainstays like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, also No but it can be. It has some AMAZING qualities, the art style of course, the faster-paced gameplay, and I really like the combat that puts so much emphasis on the countdown mechanics etc. However as many have stated the game is wildly unbalanced or at least unbalanced enough that it feels like it's impossible to have good runs. I definitely feel like this issue can be fixed, I am not a developer so I can't say how, but I know it's possible! And I still have hope for this gameThe developers have made an amazing game and I really hope they take in the good that they've made here, this is a strong foundation. The clock that you use to refill your hand is such a neat mechanic. Injuries make you feel like you're a team rather than a deck of cards. This game doesn't just present a game like Slay the spire it presents a world silly as it might be.If the release is the end of the road for this game, then I am happy enough with the product even if I don't recommend it. However, if this game gets a balance update and maybe just a few updates I think this can be a gem!"
1811990,1,136635431,"Unsure why people think this game is too hard.... I was a bit worried after reading some negative reviews, but I bit the bullet and bought it, and the game is fantastic. I'm unsure where people are having issues with winning, as the game feels perfectly challenging. You can't play this game by just hoping you're so powerful it's brain dead, there is more thought that gets put into each battle. Definitely give it try if you're on the fence."
1811990,1,136634848,"Git gud, guys"
307950,1,136635371,"While third person shooters are seen as almost the pineapple pizza of video games, ive always had a soft spot for the genre.the movement feels very simple but is far from clunky. the operators look amazing and are super fun to collect and grind for.overall a very great game that is worth checking out if the term third-person doesnt make you vomit"
307950,0,136633182,"The idea of the game is good, but the server connection situation is bloody horrible. The lag is not only happened when I combat with other players, and it also makes me cannot reconnect my special operation game. At the end, I must abandon my teammates and got the punishment. As a OZ hardcore gamer, I feel sad be abandoned from nearly all gaming companies in the world...they might charge us the top level price and give a s,h,i,t to us like that...X("
2198070,1,136635006,"It's really chill game. Although the game is difficult at first, you start having fun when you get used to the game later on.Art design is pretty nice. It can be played to clear the head during the day.I definitely recommend it. Congratulations to Dora and Stratera Games, they did a great job."

Get one day of pinball Pass for free and play 70% of the tables right now.I DID NOT play the 3DS zen pinball game but wen I was a kid I played a little game called \"Big Race USA\" which took my understanding and love for pinball to the next level.I want to talk about the history I have with the Pinball FX  franchise.  There's a ton of love but also some painful things.XBOX LIVE ARCADE.  Xbox 360 i was introduced to Pinball FX.  Okay, it ran at a terrible 60FPS but it was almost the definitive version.  It had local SPLIT SCREEN.  it had 4-player Online Multiplayer with our avatars in the 4 corners.  I owned all of the tables.Welp, i NEVER owned an Xbox One and never played Pinball FX2 on an XBONE so that means I LOSE ALL MY TABLES.But that's okay because Pinball FX2 VR comes out and now I can put my face INSIDE of the table.They added a few DLCs.  Def not enough.  (Balls of Steel in VR would've been appreciated.  idk.)Now I've been buying tables on Steam anytime there's a sale.  I own a decent amount.It's like rebuilding my old library.  And Now it seems like I don't own any again.Apparently I own \"Heavy Hitters\" on Pinball FX3.  A $10 pack of tables.  (probably got it on sale.)But it says I can complete the pack for $5 (50% off).  So if you buy Pinball FX tables you get the Pinball FX3 table with it.Who's going back to Pinball FX3?  I guess Me cuz why do we pay $5 for raytracing? I actually own one month of Pinball Pass on my Xbox Series X and playing it on there a little.  And that seems like the route to go.I will prob buy the new tables on here tho.  I like the Godzilla one!"

2377980,1,136635232,"https://youtu.be/iv7PROMZ8-Q https://rumble.com/v2hzzq8-dye-the-bunny-gameplay-indie-horror-game-ending.html A new indie Easter themed horror game came out today and the protagonist is Ellie, a kid that should've listened to her parents and not wonder the streets by her own. The game is really cheap and offers about half an hour of gameplay in which you can finish the game 2 times to get the both endings. You really won't do much in the game, just walk to find Easter eggs to be able to pass the area. It has some jumpscares, weird sounds, the graphics are old school and the story is a short Easter themed one."

1649740,1,136634346,"Absolutely rock solid. A top down action game with strong combat, something akin to Bloodborne, though with shooting almost like a twin stick shooter, albeit a bit more deliberate. It's fast, precise, pretty tough, but fair. You have to juggle multiple types of attacks which flow together nicely, making encounters almost puzzle-like as you figure out the best strategy and maximize the use of your resources. The aesthetic is quite strong as well, with stellar art direction. I confess that I'm finding the narrative a bit abstruse at the moment, but that might clear up with time. The important part is that it has enough intrigue to pull me along, and a powerful core combat element that makes it worth exploring. A definite recommend!"
1649740,1,136634962,"Hunt the Night is a very enjoyable experience that often left me feeling frustrated upon defeat but having that outweighed by my need to simply try again and be victorious. Aside from a warning that a little bit of time needs to be taken to gel with the combat and familiarize with the iframes, this is a very easy game to recommend to any fan of the plethora of influences it pulls from.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foacEBQsmhQ"

1968710,1,136637047,"MEATGRINDER is a perfect showcase of what happens when a small team has a singular driving vision and don't get bogged down by adding in every idea they can think of. The core gameplay is all about jumping on moving vehicles and feeling like a badass and every design element in the game is there to make you feel just like that. The weapons are super chunky and satisfying, the challenge is adequate and even though the game isn't that long, the game is pretty replayable because of the short setpiece levels and the infinite mode. I got a review copy for free, but that doesn't impact my review in any way, I genuinely like the game. Here's a full review going in-depth on the mechanics, length and a few issues I've found if someone's interested - it's more fun than reading a 5000 word steam review :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA4WnrHrpkc"
