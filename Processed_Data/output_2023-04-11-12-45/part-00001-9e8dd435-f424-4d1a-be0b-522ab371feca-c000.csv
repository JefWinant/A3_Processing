Comfortable camera Interesting-big game world Lots of mobs Fascinating game with lots of biomesNo computer requirements On the downside. There is only one minus that I could find- Stupid mobs while fighting them, you can easily hide from them In conclusion, we can say that this is a great project, which is actively developing with good support from the developers"
