1934040,1,136513114,"This is the only game I'm willing to play all day long. Good graphics with interesting gameplay and it all works on a weak computer - it's awesome.Of the good things to note are. Comfortable camera Interesting-big game world Lots of mobs Fascinating game with lots of biomesNo computer requirements On the downside. There is only one minus that I could find- Stupid mobs while fighting them, you can easily hide from them In conclusion, we can say that this is a great project, which is actively developing with good support from the developers"
2334560,0,136513050,"The concept and art are fine, but the game's mechanics and other design decisions prevent it from being enjoyable to play. The protagonist of the tale is a mixed-race fox who aspires to be something other than an alcoholic slacker. Let's just say that the story is quite basic and that your overall goal is to change your destiny.The game plays like any other action/platformer. You can jump, scale walls, and attack. You immediately realize that the stamina system is involved in all actions, which is fine when done correctly and just for certain acts. However, in this game it‚Äôs highly aggravating because jumping also depletes your stamina. Platformers require a lot of jumping, thus you'll spend most of your time waiting for it to fully recharge before making a jump. Then wait once again on the following platform. And again.The same goes for combat. Each battle becomes a chore due to the very slow recharge. You're moving around wasting a lot of your stamina trying to gather enough for just one hit. When you have enough experience points, you can increase your stats, but you must first kill enemies who use a totally absurd mechanic.Enemies are brainless. They will follow you anywhere you go if you are in their line of sight, including across ledges, into pits, under spikes, etc. It is usually simpler to lure them into traps, which kill them and leave their corpse hovering in the air.The game goes with old-school style of progress, which means linear path and no option to revisit stages. Even if stages include numerous paths and secret spots with gold and treasure, it's difficult to collect everything because it's so easy to die. Furthermore, if you just head for the exit, you can make things much tougher for yourself because each coin and experience point is valuable.The overall difficulty of the game was the final straw that broke my back. There are traps everywhere, coming out of nowhere and taking cheap shots at you. Even if you survive falling into a hole, you most likely won't have the strength to climb out.What makes this even more annoying is the lack of checkpoints. If you die, everything you collect is lost and entire progress reset. Any kind of exploration is entirely discouraged because you don‚Äôt want to spend time by carefully navigating the stage, collecting everything you can and then get killed by a stray arrow."
1400910,1,136514066,"Waited for 1.0 to drop to put this out finally.This game is a MASSIVE step up from the first game in every way. The music, the movement, the effects, the editor, literally everything. All of the tracks are diverse with different genres that one or two might have a special place in your heart, the movement being silky smooth makes the experience much more better and doesn't feel clunky at all, (unlike Soundodger+) the effects give the levels a much more stronger vibe to them and the freedom you have in the editor this time is insane. The game can sometimes not be very friendly with new players I'm gonna be honest and adding the shatter system on top of that can definitely ruin a players experience if they just want to play all of the levels for fun, but for people who want a challenge will most likely enjoy it. I've mostly spent my time on the editor on this game, but the main levels are really fun to play and the challenge level have cool mechanics that challenge your skill in unique and different ways. The easy and normal levels sometimes can feel lackluster, boring, slow, empty, etc. The advanced and expert levels can give you the real fun of the game. (though sometimes they're a big difficulty jump from their easier counterparts.)Overall If you're really into bullet hell, this game is a must have. It's really fun and its tracks are absolute bangers."
2248580,1,136512233,"OMG, this game is sooo cute and fun! üòç I love finding the cats and turning them back into catgirls. They are all so adorable and sweet. The puzzles are easy but not boring, and the music is relaxing and soothing. I feel like I‚Äôm in a kawaii paradise when I play this game. üíïThe best part is that there are so many catgirls to choose from, and they all have different personalities and styles. I can‚Äôt decide which one is my favorite. Maybe the pink one with the glasses, or the blue one with the bow. They are all so purrfect! üòªThis game is a must-play for anyone who loves cats, anime, or just cute things in general. It will make you smile and melt your heart. I give it 5 stars and two paws up! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüêæüêæ"
2364250,1,136512230,"It's like a tough and unfair life, where we start with a small store and a small budget to develop to a large chain of stores."
1409300,0,136513866,"This game supposed to be fun, but there was this moment when I move my MC Setyo the game got stuck or choppy or laggy or whatever it is.I hope the other players who got excited over this game didn't share the same experience as I do.Please, optimized the game, thank you."
1729900,1,135237351,"[h1]Before I played Rhythm Brawl, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
1729900,1,122580797,"cool, has potential but i think the drawings should be done before anything else."
1729900,1,125559837,ms paint rhythm my belowed
1729900,0,121230865,"Rhythm Brawl, unlike most games I don't recommend, has A LOT of promise. I VERY MUCH so hope this game gets an update that fixes all issues, because I believe that this game could be something magical if fixed in the future. also I HIGHLY encourage the developer/developers to reply to this message once an update is put out! I would love to change this review to a recommend.First off, A LOT of the art is unfinished. I'm of the belief that if you plan on making a commercial product, you HAVE to finish those kinds of assets beforehand. I understand this game is in Early Access, but this feels like an EARLY EARLY ACCESS. A would love to also see different character have different passive abilities and maybe an attack move that's different per character. More music would be awesome as well. Along with this, online play would be huge for a game like this. My final thoughts are that if you add Steam Workshop this could be the defacto Rhythm Fighting game that people have been begging for. You have something special here. Please add Steam Workshop. Other than that, if the game fixes these issues, this will be an incredible game."
1729900,1,121311975,I get more points than NPC and still lose what wrong with game.
1729900,0,118681190,"Rhythm Brawl is a laughably poor Guitar Hero ripoff with an adversarial bent as you play a 3 button rhythm game to some pretty craptastic music and wonder why Valve doesn't have the quality control for Steam it so badly needs.  There's a few different game modes and you can play PvP or vs the computer or just watch the computer play itself, this is convenient because while the computer is playing itself you can go find a pencil to rupture your eardrums so you don't have to listen to the crap music anymore.  Very thoughtful of the developers there. The nicest thing I can say about this is that it doesn't use 2D retro pixel \"art\".  Unfortunately, instead, it uses some of the most eye gougingly bad high school art class dropout drawings (I won't deign to call that scribbling \"art\") instead.  Like really bad.  Pixel art would be better, seriously, it's atrocious.  The developers indicated they would replace it, but that hasn't happened yet, so the game gets judged for what it is. There's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.Some of the defects in the game can be attributed to the choice of using the Godot game engine/toolset.  This is a very poor quality toolset sometimes used by amateur developers as it's free (so they don't have to pay for GameMaker Studio) and doesn't require advanced game development skills, but unfortunately has very limited capabilities (it's arguably worse than GameMaker Studio).  Just as you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear, you can't make a great video game if you use a terrible engine.They're seriously trying to charge money for this, $4 USD plus an eye watering $8 USD to unlock the rest of the game they haven't finished (yeah, there's DLC for an incomplete Early Access game, that's not okay to the point of being unethical).  All that for a business model to try compete with Spotify by charging $12 USD for 6 crap songs on Steam.  Ugh.  If you play this game I recommend proactively seeing an oncologist afterwards."
1729900,0,119682629,"Now let me get this out of the way. The game has potential. But right now it's very clearly unfinished. My first problem is there being no tutorial, thankfully somebody posted a guide explaining the basic mechanics. Apparently there's a flow mode and different characters have different things they specialize in (For example: More damage but you take more damage, stronger flow mode, etc.) But I didn't even realize this for the first 10 minutes since none of this is explained to you. Even the guide doesn't specify what character does what. Also, speaking of characters. Their designs for most of them are unfinished. One character looks like they got somebody else to draw smoothly. The rest though are hand drawn models that look like a deveant art OC. Hell, in actual matches there's not even the character model. Just a rough sketch with basic outlines. Now (In my opinion) the worst thing about this game is there's no online multiplayer. Sure you CAN play with friends. But that seems local only. It could be a 6/10 with the online multiplayers, but without it (including the rest of my points) it drops down to about a 4-5/10. Fix all these issues and you got a solid 7-8/10 rythm Game.TLDR; Add a tutorial and online multiplayer, along with finishing the characters and you get a solid game."
1729900,1,116989907,"Hey. It's really good. Songs are good, Gameplay is alright. This is pretty good!"
1729900,1,114308657,"Although I found some satisfaction in the game, the gameplay isn't very diverse. Jumps and jacks are the only patterns I've seen. Furthermore, I think there should be more settings, like the ability to change from downscroll to upscroll, as well as change the scroll speed like in normal rhythm games. It is also quite complex to learn the controls since you need to switch between different attacks while hitting different notes. I believe there should only be light attacks, heavy attacks, and blocks otherwise the gameplay would be too complicated since you would need to fight your opponent while hitting your notes with your other hand. Additionally, the mapping appears out of sync, especially in Vertigo. In order to preserve the true feeling of a singing competition between two great musicians, I believe more hard and upbeat songs should be added. I also find it strange that two people would be fighting while singing, but since that's the point of the game, I think it's fine. Moreover, I believe that different game modes, such as 4K, 7K, 9K, etc., should be added. As a conclusion, I think that hard charts and different genres of music should be added to keep the game from becoming boring and bland, and that more content should be added to allow players to discover what they're good at. I think this is a good start for this type of game and its concept."
1729900,1,115583159,"When I first played this game, it was hardly playable. So I just uninstalled it. However, after a long hiatus and re-installing the game. I have to say, I'm looking forward to the finished product! They've come a long way."
1729900,1,116734222,Its not finished yet but honestly it has great potential and could become a big game

2364250,1,136514533,A cool game in which you have to make your own supermarket. Of the pluses is the fact that money is accumulated even if you do not enter the game. I love clickers and this game is no exception. I recommend
2349550,1,136514247,IS quite interesting even for a second one. while a lot deeper than the first can give you time to reflect back upon yourself.secret word: strength.combine word : garden strength.
1685730,1,136515152,"Wery good game:Pros:- story- landscape- puzzles (very good)I can recommend it, with hope for more games like that."
2227150,1,136514584,"Pretty neat platformer, controls are tight. Jumps are easy to make, and a good variety in stages. I'm going to lead with letting you know this game is very short, but it is enjoyable its entire duration. I think a good thing to do after beating all the levels and collecting all the 40 (? it was an even number I arrived at and I stopped seeing anymore) green coins is to try to beat all the levels with sub-one minute times. The levels feel like they're specifically engineered for this time frame in mind and it forces you to play creatively. I want to see this expanded into a larger game. I think the mechanics are polished and the understanding of how to implement platforming gimmicks is there. The dev is obviously very skilled at what they do. I think I got more than 3 dollars of fun out of this. I think an expansion on the concept should provide a purpose to the in game timer, such as beating a dev time or maybe a standalone collectable like the crash bandicoot games.This is a ringing endorsement but I am going to post the few observances I have with the game after this, as well as my level times. (played with a controller)good+ All platforming is incredibly tight and telegraphed very well. + The little overworld is very fun to navigate however small it is. There is one out of the way place that immediately opens a warp after getting it and you can actually skip a few intended platforming parts using the core mechanics.neutral= there is an acceleration you have with gliding, it feels like the opposite of what gliding would normally do. I consider this neutral because after you get used to it it feels very satisfying to move around, but there is a learning curve.= physics with any moving stage gimmicks can be odd at times. It's consistent and you can actually use little things like leverage from spinning platforms to push yourself upwards a bit for more air but it may not do what you expect at first.= In my opinion, I think the gold coins should be finite. It would give an easy third goal to the areas, and you can very easily afford everything even without the respawns. being able to grind it feels like I didn't earn it. I don't know how much I can criticize the economy in a 3d platformer though. bad (these are really really minor issues)- recovery from a dive seems inconsistent. Sometimes I can recover and other times I feel like I can't and go barreling off the edge. This feels intentional but I couldn't get a feel for what triggered specific reactions.- The camera snap during the sections where you're repeatedly hitting boosts is a little jarring. This only happens once or twice.- I would like a little page in the menu that tells you all the information from the levels you completed. this is small but would be important for a larger game. It would have made tracking my level times at the end slightly easier too.------ Level Times01 - 00:58:80202 - 00:51:56603 - 00:48:94904 - 00:51:48505 - 00:55:51306 - 00:54:91407 - 00:41:24808 - 00:41:32009 - 00:58:07310 - 00:48:492"
2103530,1,136517189,"A very awesome game, even though some (not all) concepts are similar to Melvor Idle which I don't mind, I like the these type of idle based html/web like based games."

2151770,1,136518027,"Fun action roguelike with unique art and interesting gameplay. It starts a bit slow, but gets a lot better once you grab a few perks.The main gameplay is typical for the genre. You advance through randomly created floors, defeat enemies, gather coins to spend on better goods in shops, and open boxes with perks. Everything is lost upon death, with the exception of special keys and stat improvements.The unique mechanic is the blue and yellow energy. Numerous things are connected to each energy, and you can change at will. Examples include opponents that can only be wounded with the appropriate energy and chests that open only with the matching color. Additionally, some weapons and perks are energy-specific; they simply don‚Äôt work if you have the opposite energy. Fortunately, most enemies are in neutral energy, so you won't have to continually switch during combat.Three keys are unique to each floor and are hidden in unique puzzle areas. These challenges disable your ability to switch between energies but give you doors that, after you pass through them, switch between the two colors. The goal is to push boxes and use doors to reach the final room with the key. You keep these keys forever because they let you open unique chests that make subsequent runs a little bit simpler. But the most important is the puzzle room that gives you coins at the beginning of each run.The reason you want to do that is that items are pricey. It's nearly impossible to purchase anything just by eliminating enemies that randomly drop a chest of coins once you finish clearing out a room. While your starting gun has unlimited ammo, the short range and fun factor just isn‚Äôt there because you simply can‚Äôt afford a better gun at the start. The game's subject is time travel and experiments, therefore each \"floor\" is set in a different time period. Most enemies show up in all the stages, but there are still enough distinct ones to keep the game interesting. Four floors might not see much, but there‚Äôs enough content here to keep you busy for a while. A nice addition is a library that gets filled with all the weapons, enemies and perks you encounter."

Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There‚Äôs no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.   As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn‚Äôt enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.  [h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3] You‚Äôll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some ‚Äúcards‚Äù belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting.   The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the ‚Äúenchanted dimension‚Äù, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won‚Äôt even need a map for orienteering, and there isn‚Äôt one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won‚Äôt witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you‚Äôll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you‚Äôll have seen everything by then.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835  [h3]Combat System[/h3] At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.  Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn‚Äôt have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft‚Äôs combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.  [h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3] You‚Äôll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product.   There‚Äôs no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft‚Äôs diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won‚Äôt need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn‚Äôt worth it anyway.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780  [h3]Trading & Farming[/h3] Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can‚Äôt be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used.   Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won‚Äôt need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example."
2349990,1,136559985,"Really nice game, great story and Graphics."
1949030,1,136559936,"An excellently crafted remake which is well worth your time.Pros:- Intriguing story which will push you to play until you solve the case.- Well-written characters and dialogues, accompanied by superb voice acting. - Beautifully designed and diverse locations which you'll enjoy exploring.- Excellent atmosphere.Cons:- Semi-open areas feel empty regarding gameplay, as they only serve as a stage for the actual locations you need to visit.- Facial animations are not up to modern standards.- There are no real challenges or puzzles, as everything is streamlined, and you will barely have any trouble solving puzzles and combining clues."
2349550,1,136560296,My word was Proud.Glad another game from The Test Series was released. I  recommend playing this game and The Test: Secrets of the Soul; if you haven't already. I can't wait for more to come!
2166050,1,136559684,A really well designed little puzzle platformer. Great level ideas without repetition or any mechanic overstaying it's welcome. Lovely pixel art and pleasant tunes too!
1949030,0,136559763,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay. And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great."
1949030,1,136559848,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big \"case\", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable \"no right answer\" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
1949030,1,136559933,"Really good remaster for the classic Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It follows the same story as the original, which is one of the key advantages in the original, but there are many different new side quests, and the areas are larger so they can be explored better."
2060670,0,136560732,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes \"potions\" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do \"a build\". If you choose one of those \"class\" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player. If the level up options were like, 8 choices instead of 4, it would STILL be more RNG than most of these games, but it might be more friendly to try out other builds. There's just no reason to recommend this because it's closer to playing a tedious slot machine than a bullet heaven."
2156300,1,136560024,"They clearly said Unscripted was going to different from their other game.  And it is.  It has more depth,  more characterization, more backstory, more interactions. Your MC has to actually work at developing a relationship with a female character  that wants more out of life. It's not a ridiculously stupid AVN,  which is the typical  visual novel genre,  but the audience for those stories are immature frat-boys or really damaged misogynists. It took just about two hour to play through the story,  and the price might be a little steep for the one chapter,  but if we're getting additional chapters later on,  it'll be worth the investment. The art is good and the dialogue writing is well developed as well."

Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.[h1][b]Side Note : [/b][/h1][code]Looking for nice STEAM games?

1118110,1,136561484,Only 7 hours in and have finished the tutorials and am now on my own. Great concept and am enjoying the game. Everything is maxed out and have not had any stutter or lag issues I have seen others report. Here is my take so far:Pro:1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted spaceCons:1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore. 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.Anyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.

They can be items, conversation topics or just observations. Then there's two difficulties, one which helps the player a little bit in finding clues, and the other one which doesn't.I do regularly Let's Play horror (and especially indie horror) games on my YouTube channel.

1949030,1,136562691,"The narrative is fantastic if you are a fan of Sherlock and Lovecraft however the game is not as big as the previous game, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One but I honestly cannot complain. The devs did an amazing job and I have not experienced any bugs during this day one release.It can be played as a standalone game but I highly recommend playing Chapter One as well!"

Story is captivating while adding new elements to Tron Lore. My only complaint is how short the story is and how repetitive the 'de-frag' mini-game is. Otherwise, solid 9/10."
2109430,1,136561261,"Though this game is short (I completed my first run in a little over 3 hours) it's clear that a ton of thought and love was put into it. The artwork is gorgeous, the characters intriguing, the puzzles are fun (usually), the soundtrack slaps, the writing is accessible while still keeping that Tron flavor, and best of all as soon as the credits roll I'm left wanting to know more. Here's hoping this is the neon noir beginning to a whole new era of Tron.tl;dr if you like Tron and you like visual novels, you will be delighted by this game"
2109430,1,136561465,Short and sweet! Voice over would have been really appreciated but the visuals and sound scape was truly amazing and Tron worthy. Glad someone is still trying to keep the Legacy alive ;-)
2109430,1,136561253,"It's a well-done short story that brings you back to the Grid.All my criticisms are variations of \"I wish it was longer\" / \"I wish we got more time to know and interact with these characters\"; it was about a 3-hour playthrough my first time, and you can certainly speed through it much faster after you've gone through once. I think getting all the achievements today I played it 6 or 7 times total, doing all the puzzles each time, and altogether that took maybe 10 hours.If you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).I'm still going to do another playthrough or two to see if there certain outcomes I can get, so yeah, I definitely recommend it!"

2156300,0,136562281,"This review is not because I want a refund but I do want to see future episodes well maybe I like watching Car Crashes in the Highway. Spoilers AHEAD. Number 1.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR NAKED WOMEN AND BASIC PORN GO AWAY ( i believe there is no naked tag on the game ). I would like to say though even Nicholas Sparks does steamy sex in his books/movies it did not hurt him but that is not what the development team is going for (you can portray Intimacy with nudity and not be pornographic, sex sells ). No 2. Price point in 2009 Minecraft was sold for 13 dollars ( you can google this ) so is Unscripted.. do not expect Minecraft level of play ability. No 3. I ran into Saving problems while I was save scumming all the possible options to get all the possible 4 vibes which i only did 3 romantic / dreamer / Joker. (fixed by turning off the game and turning it on again ) No. 4 I got some flashing white blank in the middle of the screen during some scenes. which only appeared a few times but still annoying. also Trying to keep track of the Vibe changes seems to have stopped after the Demo version of the game. also the relationship points for ( trust ) the River char. only seemed to show during the first episode. making everything you did before demo and after demo not integrated. i.e you will go on a date with River no matter how bad you fucked up. No. 5 Second girl ( i think the name was angela lol ) during the pitch meeting seems more filler at this point to express how shitty the MC's life really is and the whole important choice there really was not that important but to give you different ways you can react to rejection / opportunity. No. 6 At least the most of the Graphics as far as i can tell ( yes i breeze thru alot of AVN ) are not recycled or horribly out of human proportions. but  i think they can do better.. ( they could have made the mc character more pleasant looking maybe not like Tom Cruise or Zac Efron but just a little more leading man like also why does not he look like his bro. ? he adopted? ) No 7. (im trying to get to ten but should have stopped at 5.) The sound Still comes on when i turn on the game even when i muted it on a previous run thru it didnt remember my settings from past run? ( ya im nitpicking at this point i know ) No. 8. one of the other reviews Said not enough save slots i didnt believe till i started scumming to try to get all the possible Vibes so yes this is the truth on that matter. No. 9 ( almost there ) During the Sex Scene you asked if you want to skip it and manually control it some how that part still buggy because i clicked no to not skip and yes to control it and it skipped. ( ya i know its a bug? still buggy at launch? dont worry i played 7 days to die thru what felt like 10 years of early access and ya that shit i still play today still buggy as hell or id like to think of it as a feature ) No. 10 Finally with all the bad things i might have said i would still wait to see how it ends up i been waiting for VTM Bloodline 2 since what 2019? at least Unscripted actually is out."

1685730,1,136563682,"This is a very charming game that lost all of its identity by patching in combat. Why would I sneak and craft vision-hindering arrows if I can solve every situation by just killing them? By giving the player a choice, they have honestly made it worse. The game wasnt designed for combat to begin with and it doesnt make alot of sense. The voice actress of Cynthia is extremly overplaying her part, sometimes it sounds good, sometimes its pretty cringe-worthy. Nevertheless, this is still a good little indie gem, that is rough around the edges but has a ton of heart going for it. Just dont expect anything special. Would have loved to give this a mixed review, since it doesnt deserve a negative one but also not a positive one due to the whole combat situation.

307950,1,136565224,"(I have far more playtime through the standalone launcher prior to the Steam release.)First and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.If you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!"
307950,1,136566892,"I played the Caliber since early beta and, as one can see in my achievements list, collected nearly all content available for now. And what can I say about pros and cons of this game.Pros:+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).Cons:-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.Summary: good 'heroic shooter' in realistic setting with lots of coop and competitive activities. It's good to see it on Steam at last."
307950,1,136565585,"Ok, here we go (been waiting for this since 2019)Remember Ghost Recon phantoms? SOCOM? Any third person shooter that relies on teamwork?This is game made for fans of that, if youre BF or CoD player coming here with \"Oh it doesnt have first person\" move along this aint for you anyway.As a third person shooter this game has it everything you need to enjoy, while animations arent top notch like in GR Breakpoint, this game does it decent enough.Guns feel good and different.There is one problem that new players might enncounter and that is famous grind.New players might get overhelmed by amounnt of grind u need to put out, but this is better system thann it was before, where you would have to buy new operators only with gold (each week u would get 3 new operators that would b availeble for blue credits).All to all - You like third person? You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!....and yeah, learn Russian!"

2094270,1,136565458,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. Story/Narrative:I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on \"Strange Worlds\" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.Strategy elements:I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. Issues:Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.  Overall score: 7.5"

I never felt choices were forced on the player, and most (if not all) felt very much in character with the bios presented to the player. If you're a fan of visual novels this will be exactly what you're expecting, and if you're a fan of anything Tron this will definitely scratch the itch. It provides some new lore for the universe, and gives players the immersion into the universe that movies and traditional media cannot through the lack of agency.Definitely recommend for a few hours more in the universe of Tron."

I have completed the game several times, and currently working through a play through of the release version. Even though my current hours on the release build are low, I am writing with the benefit of knowing what is coming from playing it first hand during tests.Rusted Moss takes the standard metroidvania with double jumps and replaces it with a challenging but extremely satisfying grappling hook. Some people might find the grapple a challenge at first, but I found as I played more I was able to improve my skill quickly. And once you do.... wow this game really opens up. The satisfaction of landing a sick grappling sequence, or \"breaking\" the game in ways that while intended, allow for a high level of creativity in how you approach the game. Once the game 'clicks', you feel like Spider-Man swinging around as he pleases. The game also has optional climb challenges for those who stray off the beaten path that push the limits of the grappling hook even further. The grapple challenges alone would have justified my purchase as they are extremely fun and allow you to attempt to improve your time, pushing you to be better and better. However, the grapple isn't the only element of the game, and to ignore the other elements would be a mistake as they are also excellent.The gunplay is tight and satisfying, and playing with mouse and keyboard allows for precise aiming giving me a sense of complete control of my character. When I make a mistake I know it was an execution issue on my end, not a cheap trick from the game. Save points are abundant, which allows you to experiment and go for challenges that otherwise might have seemed too risky. Boss fights have always been the thing I look forward to the most in metroidvanias and Rusted Moss does not disappoint on this front.  I especially love when the grappling hook is integrated into the fight itself as it adds a new element that I have not experienced before this.The story is an interesting take with morally ambiguous characters, fighting for their lives in a war between the Fae and Humans. With talk of prophecies, secrets, traitors, and double agents, I was fully invested into the story and wanted to progress to find out what would happen next. The music of the game adds to the atmosphere beautifully, immersing me further and further into the game. Going from making me feel transported into the world, to being hyped during a boss fight, or even scared and uneasy in an optional zone that become my instant favourite.If you are a fan of the metroidvania genre, Rusted Moss is a fresh take with a lot of fun challenges and upgrades to explore. I highly recommend the game, especially to those who ‚Äòclick‚Äô with the grappling hook as it opens up the world in a way that I found exciting."
2156300,1,136567898,"1. Realistic situations2. Realistic Dialogues 3. Realistic and astounding quality rendersI just like how realistic in this game everything is, also it somehow boosted my confidence for approaching girls lol"
1498040,0,136568791,Obtuse for no reason other than to be obtuse.  A frustrating mess.
1811990,1,136569265,"Cute artstyle aside, Wildfrost is a very well put together experience and it's NOT EA!nowdays is a rare sight to buy a finished game at launch day, tho i still hope more content will be added.my latest clear team was too powerful i fear i might not be able to beat them anytime soon hahahaha A must buy for roguelike fans."
2216700,1,136568695,i actually remember seeing the developer on TikTok just last year im excited to see the game finally being released.well im looking forward to facing the challenges and hopefully completing it
1811990,1,136568995,"It's charming, challenging and very very fun. Deckbuilding done right. 10/10"
1811990,1,136569382,"Difficult, but enjoyable (so far)."
1811990,1,136568300,"Played the demo, fall in love with it. Played only a bit of base game (gonna play more when I have free time), but I right now can say this will be the game I play for coming weeks."
1811990,1,136568431,"Really nicely designed game. Feels very rogue-ey, lots of difficulty spikes and many runs needed to get deep but fun."
1811990,1,136568525,big berry my love
1811990,1,136568174,"Needs to play more of the game, but just wanna drop a positive impression to help with the review score.I love everything about this game ever since the demo, the charming as heck artstyle, the music, the depth of all play with your allies, clunker, charms, etc., that adds to the synergy.Two of my favorite deckbuilders are Slay the Spire and Vault of the Void, and I have a good feeling that Wildfrost will end up close to those two. If you love roguelite deckbuilders, this game is a no brainer."
1811990,0,136567852,"It's a neat alternative to Slay The Spire...but holy shit Poison is such a horrible mechanic and healing in this game is absurdly rare outside of your first run so you better make it count. I've had more than 10 runs in this game so far and pretty much all my deaths have been due to \"well the starting deck is dogshit so i guess i'm dying on the second fight again\"\""
1811990,1,136567848,"I already played the demo for a while and I was really, really looking forward to this game.I'm hooked on deckbuilding roguelikes ever since StP and this is one of the best I've ever played.The artstyle and the animations are gorgeous, the spins and turns on the ageing deckbuilding genre are refreshing and I can really recommend this game to anyone who has ever played a deckbuilding game and thought \"well, this is fun!\"10/10 definitely my indie game of the year so far."

307950,0,136569128,"I'd rather play Warface then this. Horrible design Choices: 1. The Hud is a cluster fuck 2. You have a picture as a Scope (???) 3. Unlocking Operators takes forever 4. You respawn with the same amount of ammo you had before dying (???) 5. Ammo Boxes have a 5 minute cooldown 6. You only have 3 mags and it takes almost a full one to kill someone 7. You can only use your grenade/rpg once a match 8. Pretty much pay2win with the operators since you can just buy them, one has a one shot sniper 9. Horrible voice acting 10. You cant preview any Items 11. You can only pick 1 Item from a Lootbox and Finally 12. Bad Optimisation, i get more fps playing MW 2022."
307950,1,136568966,"I have been playing this game since OBT and enjoying it ever since. The game is dynamic, has various game modes (with Frontline being my favorite) and has a great variety of operators. While being free, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win thing. I'm glad that it's finally on Steam so there's no need to use the separate launcher. All the best to the devs, you're going a great job!"
307950,1,136568944,Nice game!Loads of different characters with cool customization
307950,1,136568749,"I`ve been playing Caliber since its Beta through their own launcher. Now it`s on Steam with tons of content for new players (lucky guys) and what is more important - with new game mechanics, game modes and more. It`s not only free-to-play game, but it`s free indeed, you can play and grind, all operators can be purchased for in-game credits which are gained through playing (except the newest operators from the last battle pass, which is fine, as they become available for credits). The game process is fun, so cool to gather with friends and spend some time here. But you have to learn the mecanics, study base principles and operators perks. Glad that Caliber released on Steam to get new players and expand its community. Good luck to the team and players!"
307950,1,136568878,Fun so far
307950,1,136568674,"A week ago I was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I was waiting for this game for quite some time, so i'm glad I was able to play this before I go. I don't know how many people will see this; but I recommend to you to play this game if you do see it. Gameplay, atmosphere, graphics. everything was done perfectly. If you read it, thank you and good bye."
307950,1,136568469,A wonderful guaranteed game worth playing. Much better and more beautiful than CS:GO or other games.

1949030,1,136570876,"I love all the Frogwares Sherlock games! And one combined with Cthulhu is even better. I love the atmosphere and had not a single issue streaming it, so it is well balanced (no bug or crash for me).And my picture made it into the game, what an honour (kickstarter). :D Can only recommend this game!"
2109430,1,136570789,"Channels the Tron aesthetic through and through, story is good and encourages multiple playthroughs. Puzzles are fun, smart and just difficult enough.Highly recommend!"

2109430,1,136571936,"Great writing, music and really strong visual presentation"
2156300,0,136569545,"I'll preface this by saying, it's still very early, and this is just one episode, but here are my impressions so far.1.  There are really no options.  You have one woman to impress and god forbid you choose wrong in one of the options you have, she'll friendzone you.  If you didn't find her attractive (and I really didn't--she was too heavy for my taste), then too bad.  She's the only choice in the game so far.2.  No roll back.  Did you hit one of the choices accidentally?  Too bad. Replay the entire thing, or create tons of saves as you go.3.  This next one goes towards the \"dating sim\" aspect.  If the one woman pisses you off (which she did), there's no option to tell her to go **** herself and walk off.  You're forced to be nice.  I would really have liked a \"b*tch, I have enough friends\" option.  I've never let a woman friendzone me IRL, and I certainly don't want to do it in a game.  There's great satisfaction in ghosting women like that.4.  I suppose because it was by the same people that did College Kings, I was expecting at least the chance to have some good, meaningless sex.  That was not to be the case.  I suppose this game is G rated, or PG at best.  My hope is that the more episodes that come out, the more this will change.  I can \"not have sex\" with as many women as I want IRL. There's no need to go to a game to do it.5.  I both understand and enjoy the necessity to build up to a relationship.  It was my favorite part about games like BaD and College Kings, but both of those games gave you significant feedback when you did something that would cause a girl to friendzone you, or not like you, or whatever, and you weren't friendzoned... you were merely \"in progress\" and the girls kind of let you know that.  In this episode, I got friendzoned and had no idea why.  None.Again, however, this is all after just one episode.  Perhaps there's still hope and I do look forward to the upcoming episodes, but the lack of a rollback option is just AWFUL!  If you want to add an \"ironman\" mode where you can't rollback, by all means, do so.  I generally do my first playthrough keeping as true to how I would personally answer as I can and some kind of ironman mode for that would be fine, but to force everyone to play that way every time is absurd.TLDR: As far as the final recommendation, I'm going to say for those seeking an AVN, this isn't it.  This is a teenage visual novel at best... no adult content whatsoever.  The dialogue is fun, even funny at points, but in it's current 1 episode state, I can't in good conscience, recommend it in its current state.  I will update the review as new episodes are released."
2156300,0,136571278,"EPISODE 1 is very small , many glitches are there. The story is fine but not much grabbing."
2216700,1,136571118,i never expected after defeating some bosses a number of times they actually evolve and they become tougher.love the fact that its challenging and have to create new strategies on defeating them afterwards
1811990,1,136571418,"It's difficult, but not absurdly so - if you have played card based games in the past, you need to adapt to the unique counter twist this game puts on things. But the moment that clicks, it just becomes an incredibly fun puzzle to win the battles.The runs are fairly short (an hour to two, depending on how long you think about turns), which is a real plus for me - I can play a single run and then hop and do something else for a while.The progression unlocks different tribes (card sets) and some new cards, but the cards you have in the beginning are completely valid to win a run.Cards can be upgraded in a run to focus on different builds.The art style is amazing. The UI is great, it runs smooth and the music is incredibly cool.And if you're 1 coin short in the shop and click an item repeatedly, the shop keeper takes pity on you and sells it regardless. Whats not to love?Give it a try. It's a great game."
1811990,1,136570370,"Accidentally killed my own leader and lost the first daily run ever, 10/10 already loving it."

307950,0,136570930,"(BTW I have a bit more game time than what steam shows because I merged my account to steam) I really want to like this game, but there is one particular thing about PVP that kills it for a lot of people. YOUR STAMINA DOES NOT REGENERATE AFTER ROUNDS ARE OVER. This absolutely makes no sense and they still have not got rid of it. Additionally, I am already seeing a bad sign of some cringy looking operators coming in this game. They already have one, and of course they made it a US \"operator\", that is wearing a mask and is the shit we do not need in our tactical shooter games."
307950,1,136571629,"If you like SOCOM, you might like Caliber. It's not perfect but not bad either and i'm having fun with game so that's all that matters right."

307950,1,136570309,A pretty chill shooter to play
307950,0,136569728,"Sinceramente, llevo desde el inicio de la beta en Europa y este juego esta a√±os luz de ser bueno, los propios Devs lo joden con sus cambios/nerfs a cosas que no tienen ni puto sentido, de pedir mas dificultad en PvE cuando tiene al 80% de su playerbase que se caga encima y la mayor dificultad que pueden asimilar es el prologo, el PvP es la mayor mierda de cualquier juego que se pueda ver, el sistema de habilidades lo rompe por completo y lo acompa√±a el sistema de estamina, la mecanica de press Q to win, la skills rotas, personajes completamente desbalanceados desde hace a√±os, la increible desync y lag que hay en PvP, los peores matchmaking que he podido ver en un PvP, el micropago del juego es entre inutil y caro para lo que da actualmente, el grindeo es muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuy lento y pesado, los battlepasses son tranquilamente lo peor en un F2P (4 battlepasses de 25 niveles) y no te devuelven lo que pagas, siendo honesto hay muchos juegos F2P mejores que Caliber. Ojo que a mi el juego me encanta pero las cosas por su nombre. Merece la pena jugarlo? Si, pero id preparados."
307950,1,136570261,"Playing for 1 yaer before steam release, pretty good and no p2w!"

Here I can try different tactics with my teammates. Well, the visual part pleases with the detailing of operatives and weapons.I wish you all good luck in Caliber!"
2363930,1,136572886,this is a must play for fans of Evil Dead. a great blend of horror and cheese
2103530,0,136573912,Not as good as melvor idle.  It does however have some multiplayer aspects that Melvor idle doesn't.  I am not a huge fan of the way they are attempting to get money out of you.  It is one thing to purchase a game and have it all unlocked.  It is another thing to offer purchases that have limited time amounts.  Overall it is meh.  Not good and not bad.
1934040,0,136573460,"At the release date this game feels like its unfinished. i have not found any outstanding bugs or irregularities in performance but after only a few hours of actual gameplay it feels really repetitive without foresight to further complexity or progression.It is fun and quite relaxing but sadly there is not enough gameplay for me to come back to the game if this is the \"Final\" version.I hope to see this game develop more and watch it become something i could spend years playing, but for now i would be bored after 10 hours of gameplay and in 13 hours i would have all the achievements."
2248580,1,136574702,"At first glance the puzzle seems simple, but your brain starts thinking like hell. It's great to come home from work and relax to nice music. Loved the art with the cat girls. The only thing they lack is animation, hopefully the developers will fix that. The well thought out story and interaction with the characters drew me into this game. I was surprised that such a simple looking game had multiple endings to choose from. This gave me the incentive to explore other story options. If you love puzzles, kittens, and all things cute, this game is definitely for you! üòª"
1409300,1,136573277,"What a great start by Pendopo Creations to take a debut step in a early Q2 2023. This game kinda remind me of Lacuna and Virtua Verse since those games look pretty similar. But, review is review so I'm gonna tell what I felt and experienced while playing this game. Start by the premise of story, Setyo starting to take a step in Bay City as a foreign agent and then as a security of a tech company. While his colleague, Jack, who works in Bureau appearing in Bay City and gave Setyo a bad news about the lost of his sister so it forced Setyo coming back to Neo-Surabaya and find some clues about his sister. All I can say, the plot is properly wrapped in a 6 chapters in total which makes the story more focused. The story doesn't feel rushed at all. Plot is surprisingly attractive so the experience kinda similar as watching a movie. Besides that, the dialog is well written in english. So, from the story aspect, I could say this game is a have a great plot, not rushed, and a well-written dialog. For Indonesian folks, trust me, some of the dialog is so much related to our culture and society nowadays. One of my favorite is while there's a conversation talking about \"a department\" of a country that loved to block an access of one of a biggest game marketplace in a world.Story: 8/10Move into the gameplay, this game, put it simply, is an action adventure game with a side-scrolling thingy like Lacuna and VirtuaVerse. The most important value that been delivered by dev to this game is at puzzle and combat mechanics. Puzzle mechs are variative which make this game has a bit of repetitive level. I'm sure that you're not gonna get bored while facing all puzzles in every chapter on this game. Okay, let's say some of them are stealth, hacking like a Watchdogs game, bunker code solving, making a key, \"stay calm while disguise\" with a rythm alike system, etc. There's so much variation of puzzle so I can't put it here all one by one. Besides puzzle thingy, this game also have a freedom for us to fight some foes with any weapon and a combat system. A combat system is quite okay, i think. One thing that annoyed me is just an energy and consumable items while in a fight. Energy drought so fast and consumable items a bit complicated since you need to open an inventory first and the consume the item. It will be better IF this game giving us a \"quick action button\" so we don't need to try hard anymore. Gameplay: 7,5/10The graphics is lovely jubbly. Imagine, the composition of 2.5D pixelated game combined with a proper lighting and synthwave colour tone is just right. It looks satisfying. This game is actually worth for some players who loves to see a pixelated or cyberpunk game themed. Give it a try!Graphics: 8.5/10Finally, talking about sound/audio. All I can say is the background music is well delivered in any situation so the tense properly build up while playing the game. When we need to be relax, stressed, pressured, it's all depicted good by a presence of a cyberpunk themed music. Sound: 7/10So, in the end, the pros and cons of this game arePros:+Better plot, movie alike and doesn't feel cheap. +Puzzle mechs variative which makes the experience doesn't feel bored.+Dialog is well written, some of them talking about Indonesian culture and society issues+Oooomagaaa, the graphics bro, beautiful. +There is so many Indonesian thingy in a game like tukang sate, kang cilok, preman, pertunjukan seni, etc while the game is delivered to be fantasy futuristic. Cons: - Game still buggy and stuck at loading because of steam overlay. pro tip: don't ever open a steam overlay while playing the game. Let's hope the dev will fix it, asap.- Combat system duh idk, all i want is a \"quick action button\" and some clarity improvement while in a stealth mission. - Bahasa Indonesianya ga ada cookkk, semoga ntar ditambahin hehe, ksabar.- There is no manual savingOverall, this game is at 7,75/10. Is this recommended? Yes, it is recommended. With this rate of price, you can get an experience of exploring to a deep down of an Indonesian greatest civilization with hi-tech thingy with a great story and puzzle mechs. Let's go give em a try!"
2371750,1,136573988,"Must get for a fun game that you can play with all levels of focus. Fun, simple and clear path to victory. Cute animations and fun sounds. very nice."
2357670,1,136573048,"This game has original, awesome Art design and a fun concept combining interactivity and card games, skill and luck. I will definitely be playing more to get better at the mechanic and die less! The humor is a bonus, and I personally love the character drawings and facial expressions. Looking forward to unlocking the whole map!"
2357670,1,136572986,"If you're a fan of strategic gameplay and love collecting cards, then this card battler game is definitely for you! This game is a perfect combination of card collection, deck building, and tactical combat. It is very easy to pick up and play but has enough depth to encourage replays to improve your strategy.The hand-drawn artwork in this game is awesome, from the unique and varied card designs to the incredibly detailed backgrounds and interfaces. The music is fantastic and perfectly suits the action in the game. Each card has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be augmented with skills and loot, so each round requires careful consideration and strategic thinking.Overall I really enjoy Fourteen Fiends for its fun, quick gameplay and the potential for deeper strategy from different combinations of cards. Highly recommended!"
1949030,1,136574485,"I'm only 4 hours in but I wanted to say that I love this game. It's different from the other Frogwares Sherlock Holmes games in that you are solving one grand overarching mystery rather than individual cases, so I haven't had the experience of having to pick who I thought did it with what in that intense and wonderful way that the other games have, but the story that it is telling is so damn compelling that I don't care. I'm still finding clues and slowly piecing together what's happening, all while people are dying and crazy supernatural stuff is happening around me.The juxtaposition of Lovecraft and Holmes works perfectly, the aesthetics combine well, and I love Holmes' analytical mind trying to work out why there's weird supernatural bullshit happening. I'm super excited to find out what is going on. On the mechanical side, this game uses the same engine as Chapter One but adds some excellent quality of life improvements. For one, I think the open world was a detriment to Chapter One, and this one is much more linear which is good. For another you can click Z to have all of the interactable items pop up around you, which is an amazing thing to have in this sort of mystery adventure game.Special shoutout to the characterization, writing, and acting of Watson in this, he is so good.Very excited to continue, and congrats to Frogwares for a great game."
1949030,1,136573584,"Love this game! It builds upon the characters and game design of the previous game, but with a much darker atmosphere. I also personally liked that the story felt more linear and self-contained compared to the open world of Chapter One. Overall just a really solid and fun detective game!"
1919720,0,136574310,"The game released in a promising state on Early Access: The foundation was there, the gameplay loop was fun, decent spells and even if it was lacking in both content and mechanics at the time, the hints of what was upcoming was promising and would have very likely made it a great game in the genre. I don't know what happened but unfortunately the game barely received any updates during the Early access period and was left in an incomplete state that just make it hard to recommend to anyone. The Early Access tag was simply removed during release day without any content update, which means that the devs were unable to continue working on the game for any reason.I'm deeply disappointed because from all the games in the genre this was the one that perhaps I was the most excited about because I really liked the overall setting and base spells but if you are looking for a game of this type my suggestion is to play something else."
1949030,1,136572611,"Sherlock Holmes REVIEW..Pros: - Graphics remaster looks nice- Puzzles are good fun (Drove me insane)- Game play feels nice - 100% is easily  doneCons: None, I very much enjoyed this edition of the game, if anything maybe the price is a little high for a \"remaster\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XXBChnRxSg"
2109430,1,136572582,"Very amazing game, as a Tron fan but not someone big on visual novels it's absolutely everything I could ever want with new lore, great new characters that i will protect at all costs (1 in particular), and a great story. Thank you Mike and the team!!!"
1949030,1,136572813,"Short, but nice atmosphere and characters."
1772830,1,136573476,"Was lucky enough to get to playtest this game, i really love the feel of the grappling hook, i've pulled off some great shenanigans with it ^^ and i'm a sucker for a good metroidvania style game.Highly recommend!"
2216700,1,136573537,this is definitely a fresh take on the genre. Nice replay-ability
1811990,1,136575013,"Really like the game so far, and it is GORGEOUS!!!"
1811990,1,136574855,"So something interesting- While I love roguelike deckbuilders, I frequently find myself frustrated with them. Slay the Spire, Dicey Dungeons, etc, they're fantastic, but bad luck can be extremely frustrating.I'm not having this problem with Wildfrost.Now obviously I've only played an hour so far, and I definitely haven't made much progress, but every time I've died so far, I've always felt like it's my fault in some way, whether I made a stupid decision or didn't prepare well, and even in the times when RNG has screwed me via lacking options for card synergy or in-battle junk, it still feels so much less frustrating than in other roguelike deckbuilders. I think this is partially because of the way the gameplay is structured; there's no obvious endpoint, just a continuing path, and you're not spammed with cards or the like. Every encounter keeps you incredibly invested with how you're strategizing, and even when you lose, the progression with the town can help you still feel as though you're making progress.If you really want to try this game but aren't entirely sure, I'd say go for it. I'm having a blast so far and the literal only reason I'm taking a break after an hour is because I, unfortunately, have important things to do T_T But I will absolutely be back ASAP to see more of this game. I only hope I can actually strategize well enough to do well, hah."
1811990,1,136574399,"Extremely easy to learn, but challenging roguelike deck builder. It does very well to quickly get you into the game, and everything is easy to understand and play. No convolution what-so-ever. Cute art style, good music, good effects and animations.Gameplay-wise, you pick your \"hero\" card, and go on a randomly generated, mostly-linear journey and get as far as you can. Once you die, you pick a new hero and do it all over again while upgrading your town over time to provide you with new cards, items, etc.I'm not a huge fan of deck-builders or card games, but this one is definitely worth looking at and considering as it is actually a lot of fun."
1811990,1,136574565,summoned a 4 hp follower few rounds later gets poisoned for 20 dmg poor guy dissolvedfun and fair game
1811990,1,136574168,As someone who has played a ton of roguelike/lite cardgames this game is top tier in terms of quality.I will update when I get to the point where I feel as though I'm done with the game.
1811990,1,136573711,"Hitting a few bumps but only because im still learning. Doesnt mean im not having fun with the game. The art is cute, the gameplay loop is great. Also Booshu MVP."
1811990,1,136572629,Why are you reading reviews here? Shouldn't you be playing it right now?
1811990,1,136572349,"Very in depth game, super cute art style and amazing music"
1811990,1,136574174,"Difficult, but fun."
307950,1,136574957,"Niche game, I like it ..... I miss so much Ghost Recon Phantoms and this remind me a little of him.If devs are reading pls consider to add a conquest mode, possibly a vertical map with progressive zone to capture like Ghost recon phantoms or it was called also GRO - online. And if possible more players in each team with respawn ... 8vs8 would be awesome. I wish you all the best for the game."
1934040,1,136577937,"I`m currently at day 3 so maybe its to soon to write a review but i really like this game!Its fun but there are a lot of quality of life features missing, like building structures out of the inventory (currently you have to place it in your hotbar to be able to place it). Hope theres some kind of modding support coming (will take much time in unity to setup)But other than that its a pretty good game and i hope it will get more updates soon."
1400910,1,136577501,"bought it day 1 of early access, and i can say it is 100% worth it, mainly because you get to play [spoiler]SBM[/spoiler] good job beanword of warning: please be careful with community levels, these people are [u]insane[/u]"
2349550,1,136575208,"Gifted Word: ProudI love this series (and all the other ones from Randumb) soooo~ much, every \"ending\" strikes true tho. :>The Watcher is a real cool character and I love all of the questions.Now I'm gonna try out the Fateweaver Series. <3"
1685730,1,136577403,"The game has a pleasing aesthetic and atmosphere to it. The journey takes us from colorful, vibrant landscapes, into medieval dungeons and murky swamps, which presents a welcome change of scenery and mood for each chapter.The soundtrack is well done, each chapter has its own theme that fits the level and surrounding area, and the audio queues for being close to enemies or being spotted add some tension to the stealth gameplay.The puzzles are well integrated into the levels, they're not too easy but also not very difficult, which makes it a chill experience while still offering a bit of a challenge. The stealth segments of the game have a good pacing to them, the levels aren't just extended sneaking sections, but a healthy combination of stealth and exploration with some puzzles thrown into the mix for some variety in gameplay.I played with mouse and keyboard. The game is also compatible with controllers and joysticks. All controls can be remapped to your liking.The game isn't very long. You can probably finish it in about 2 hours. I messed around a bit which lead to me spending close to 4 hours in the game. However, the game being short is definitely not a negative in this case. I think that overall the chill atmosphere and semi-challenging gameplay makes for a cozy experience on a rainy afternoon.The game has some bugs in it, which is to be expected from a new release, especially one made by one developer and one 3D artist. Some of them have already been fixed in the [url=https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1685730/view/3719451786611878892] 1.0.1 hotfix [/url] that was released within a day of the launch.Most of those bugs are and were extremely minor nuisances but nothing really game breaking. Most could be fixed by simply reloading the latest checkpoint, which the game has a good amount of, so you don't really lose much progress.Cynthia comes across various collectibles throughout her journey, which offers some replayability should you have missed some. The ability to select and replay levels after completing the story would be a welcome addition, since there is no way to go back to get a collectible you might have missed other than starting a new game, which deletes your previous save.What I didn't like as much was the dissonance between the character models. Cynthia, as the player character, has great quality model with physics and a neat selection of cool outfits to collect along her adventure. However, the other NPCs, while not looking too bad, are of noticeably lower quality than Cynthia. It makes sense to have the player be more refined than the NPCs we don't see as often and up-close too much, but it is still a bit jarring during cutscenes to go from Cynthia to an NPC.The final boss fight was underwhelming and over before I knew it, I was hoping for a bit of a more elaborate final battle.It sadly felt a bit rushed.[h1]TLDR:[/h1][b]Pros:[/b][list]    [*]Charming artstyle and aesthetics    [*]Lovely OST    [*]Decently challenging puzzles    [*]Well paced gameplay    [*]Very basic character customization    [*]Collectibles offer replayability    [*]Comfortable time killer that could be finished in one sitting[/list][b]Cons:[/b][list]    [*]Minor bugs (Some already fixed, others can still be addressed)    [*]Different qualities between character models    [*]Underwhelming final Boss[/list]Overall I rate this game a 7.5/10It could have been more, but it lived up to my expectations. I definitely had fun with it and I look forward to what Catthia Games will cook up in the future."
1685730,1,136575278,"Pros:Great visual aestheticFun (but not overly complicated) puzzlesGood use of stealthCons:Couple of launch bugs (nothing game breaking and being addressed by the developer)Voice acting of the boss felt out of placePressing a button after each loading segment annoyed meOther notes:Short game - about 3-4 hours to complete.Cynthia's voice acting is fine by me, but to each their own. She is not as noticeably verbose after the initial chapter.Looks stunning at 5120x1440, but I would like a windowed mode; streaming this game (from my setup) currently would not be possible."
2227150,1,136577215,"I go by Kuri, but this aint my game lol. A sweet but short platformer, sporting 10 levels and a hub world. Movement is very fluid and it has full controller support. I would wish there was more content, but overall a fun time. All these N64 inspired platformers always tend to be extremely short, which is a shame."
1949030,0,136577967,"Very positive? Feels like bots are reviewing this.It's the 2nd worst entry after Chapter One, requiring little to no brain cells to successfully complete every mission, even on higher difficulty.There are no penalties to getting an answer wrong, because you can't really, it doesn't let you proceed with the game otherwise.That alone makes is very stupid and boring, and combined with the price tag, it's an easy no from me."
1949030,1,136577589,"It's great, but I'd really appreciate a first-person view mode like the older, pre-Chapter One games. Some clues and environmental details can be a little tough to see because a section of the camera is dedicated to the Sherlock Zone. There's a little bit of jank but considering the circumstances it was made under and the priorities of the company in those circumstances, it's totally understandable and forgivable imo."
1949030,1,136577464,"similar to sherlock chapter 1. not quite as open world (thank god). nice side stories/stuff to explore. essentially if you like the other sherlock games, you'll most likely like this one. great voice acting. nice gloomy atmophere."
1949030,1,136575832,"This game is AMAZING. The atmosphere and content is astonishing. To be honest, I was looking for more lovecraftian content, but this is good enough. Shouldn't crack the world of Sherlock after all."
2109430,1,136576231,"This is a really fun and atmospheric game. I am loving the detective elements and the puzzles. The Art style is incredible. It has drawn me into the world and I want to go back and see more Tron things. I wasn't sure I would like reading as part of gameplay, but its drawn me in along with amazing music to create an interesting and fun game. Highly recommend."
2156300,0,136575630,"While I do like the game, it has barely any content.  The choices you have to make aren't clear (would be nice if there were HINTS on each choice as to what the result is instead of GUESSING!!).  You have no control for the most part over the ONLY sex scene it has and yep, no nudity.  I mean I see the promise this game has, but way too early to release with almost no content, no control over choices (meaning no hints) and VERY expensive for a game that is bare bones.  I would tell everyone wait until there's a final product before spending that much money for this.  Yes, lots of promise -- but its only a promise.  I should have waited for the final release with patches because I am sure a lot of people want to have hints on choices, not just \"guess\" as to the best answer."
2156300,1,136575433,Finally a serious game with real characters living real lives instead of cardboard cut outs faking it through a weak plot.
1498040,1,136576438,"Very fun lil game. I'm certain there's a specific genre description for this type of gameplay, where you're just a lil dude constantly assaulted by waves upon waves of thousands of enemies & the goal is to wipe them out as efficiently as you can, but it's fun and satisfying.This one in particular seems to allow an absurd amount of customization in the way you link your weapons. It's really hard to explain in text and something that comes across better by just trying it out! Based on how you set up your links, your new upgrades can affect yourself, your enemies, your other weapons, or for example, your other weapons that proc off of hitting your other enemies, and so on and so forth (like an example - you can have a sword swinging from yourself, that inflicts poison on an enemy, that releases a nova burst every second, that inflicts a burn on enemies, which triggers something else to happen when it blows up, and so on).Quite a ton of fun for the low low price. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something small to play around with between other things."
2216700,1,136575508,some of the villains are very trickery to defeat.i spent half an hour trying to strateize on defeating the priest especially
2216700,1,136577965,found this via TikTok am looking forward to the challenge
1811990,1,136578721,"Amazing art style and music! This is the first roguelike deckbuilder that I've played that has this level of polish! It's definitely a tough game, but it feels doable and is just a ton of fun!"
1811990,1,136577400,"beautiful art, polished UI and presentation, fun cards, and creative gameplay. it's good stuff."
1811990,1,136577692,I mean I bought it planning on playing one run and here I am 4 hours later. Get this game!
1811990,1,136577351,"Had been in love with this game since Demo.I'm really not know all about Deck building game so I can't pointing out on if this is a good game for that genre or not. But I can given you a detail on what you'll get on this game.- Deck building game: Everything is card, Including you and you companions.- On your journey you can pick a cards  to assisting in your journey, So don't worry, You'll have a lot of cards.- Which also mean you have to building your own deck. The card consisted of Weapons, Companions and Equipments. Playing each card will subtracting a turn on both you and the enemies. Any card hit zero first get to hit first.- So its basically a game of wits where you'll have to manage the card you'll play before your team gets to hit  the enemies turn by turn. And trust me, Its not that easy at all. and you are going to losing alot.......This is where Rouge lite elements come into play.1. At the beginning of each match, You'll get to pick 1 out of 3 randomize heroes.  Each will have different hit point and Health point. Also some of them will come pack with the effect such as Barrage (Hit all enemies in the same row) etc. etc.2. You'l die. ALOT. Which if you are able to complete certain objective on each match. You'll progressively unlocking the building on your starting point. Allow for better equipment, companion and pets (And more)So basically, This game is best because you can swooshing in and out for a quick rush and just leave when you thing just gone down hill and coming back later for better tryout. Its really fun especially when you just want to have something casual and still feeling serious at same time.Oh yeah, And the art is cute as hell. Probably a reason why I bought this game."
1811990,1,136576984,"I really like the game <3It looks amazing, sounds amazing, and the gameplay is fresh and fun. There is a lot to discover / challenges to beat, but the meta progression focuses on unlocking new cards, rather than making things easier, which I really like.Every roguelike deckbuilder will be compared to slay the spire, I guess, but the games feel way different. So even if you don't like StS, I think its worth giving a shot"
1811990,1,136576929,"One run in right now but I played the demo a lot before release.This game SLAPS, it is amazing. Don't bother reading other reviews, try it now if you're into deckbuilders like Spire or Monster Train.Great art, catchy music, fun monster designs. The gameplay is easy to pick up and learn but difficult to master. Very fast paced for a deckbuilder once you get the swing of things as well I think."
1811990,1,136577346,I like it.
1811990,1,136576819,"It is difficult, cute, fun and satisfying. Buy it, play it, review it. It deserves your attention if you like these types of games, or just roguelikes in general.Also, the game isn't as hard as people say it is. I am horrible at these types of games and I got a win in the first 5 hours. You slowly learn what it is cool and what isn't, what is useful and which enemies are difficult."
307950,1,136577806,"PSA: Must play for SOCOM fans.I played about 150 hours in the standalone years ago. I decided that I should start playing again because now it's on Steam. They have done so many quality of life improvements that you new players can enjoy. The bullcrap system with the \"mobile game\" like daily where you send your operators to collect stuff is gone. There used to be so many currencies you had to grind and now the only basic silver & fragments is enough with the premium currency. Grinding operators to get better before was insanely boring, tedious and annoying. Now it's simple and much better. Straight line and you just spend the free to play currency to activate new talents. Graphics are good and so are about 80% of the legendary operator skins. There are few goofed up stuff but rest are some old school gear and then some tactic00l af stuff. Pick the operator you like, read what their skills do and enjoy. Store updates weekly that which operators are on discount. To all new players, please play the tutorial. I play medic 90% of the time so please, don't run away from me. If you need the heals, go to the medic or stay near the player and if the skill requires a chain or AoE don't leave it. Don't spend your syringes that much since medic can carry 6, save your one syringe when it all hits the fan. I never liked the PvP and never gonna play it. I just love to grind the simple PvE maps and modes. It's not perfect though, the new voice acting in some maps that are totally redone with \"story\" cutscenes etc. is so abysmal that you may want to mute your dialogs. It is just disgustingly bad. Some random voice actor doing stereotypically bad accents. Should have just stayed with the vanilla voices like in the old maps. There are also some really meta operators for PvE which are just hilariously OP and can carry the whole match. Bourbon is disgustingly OP as hell with Kit. It is a good free to play game and it is improving more and more. Glad they improved so many quality of life aspects needed in the game, the previous currency grind made me quit but now I can just casually play again and progress."
307950,1,136577646,"Been playing this game since the Closed Beta in 2020.Nice gunplay, fluid movement system. Sometimes slow, sometimes hectic gameplay.You could say it's a bit grindy from time to time, but there is no P2W and AFAIK, no overpowered unlocks.Patience, using cover and teamplay are the most important things."

307950,0,136577167,"Its alright, definitely not the worst F2P game on the market but... it feels like Warfaces 3rd person older brother.Ive unfortunately uninstalled it as it wasn't really what I expected but I can see some people liking it.6/10 * from me."
307950,1,136577003,FTP 4v4 Socom with PVE and PVPVE gamemodes. They have changed so much since the start of this game. They are listening to their new western audience and have changed the economy for the better in so many ways. It is free. Try it.
307950,1,136576709,Love it. Reminds me of the good ol Socom days from the Playstation 2/PSP/PS3 era
307950,1,136576739,Excellent game!
307950,0,136576275,"As someone who played this game from close Beta all I can say is stay away.After playing this game for a long time, and having a peak in Super Test environment I can tell you, honestly that this team isn't competent  and they blatantly lie. For example this year was supposed to be without any new units, however, they need money again so they're adding two more. They increased the price of everything, just to milk people dry.Their battlepasses were around 40 to 60 euros depending if you want to complete it fully, and the mod team would make fun of COD for having 10 dollar BPs that were cosmetic, while Caliber had literal pay to win collections for over 30 euros..I was once harrassed and DDOSED by the people i played against, provided literal video footage, however ScumbagJuJu who is the lead moderator, shut me up and never said anything to the russian players that literally attacked me verbally and my hardware.Another instance was where i was unrighfully banned by a moderator, where he promised a certain channel, then acted dumb and demanded i prove it or he will mute me for a certain amount of time, when i did prove it with a screenshot i asked him does he need more proof or will he stop  eating shit, which he promptly muted. Of course he was scolded by ScmubagJuJu because he was in no right to do so, yet he did. The player feedback isn't listen to, believe me, for four years we put up with their lack of balance and bullshit updates to avoid doing anything. They release a new unit, make it broken, literally pay to win, milk them for a few months and then somewhat nerf them.I've played every game mode, I have a decent amount of earned premium skins and all opeartors [besides the new pay to win americans and chinese] a lot of time spent in game as well. Their rules are so bad, you can get banned, now let me repeat, you can loose your account, for Tbagging an enemy and or friendly. That was also one of the questions i was asked when they asked me for super testing \" How would i feel if someone tbagged me\" where i answered i'd find it funny, cuz it's all in good faith and gaming fun.Whoever defends 1C with [pre or after wargaming era] is basically just sucking up to the devs, hoping for something, or is  literally coping. If you have money and time you may have fun, but nothing on the long run."
307950,0,136575701,This might be a free-to-play game but everything in the shop is overpriced. I'll consider re-reviewing the game if devs add acceptable regional pricing.
307950,1,136576268,It reminds me SOCOM but with micro-transaction
2198070,0,136578512,"Game seems horribly unbalanced. The resource generation is almost non-existent while every other card is either a road or require 10 of a resource which you just lost due to not seeing a resource generation card in 5-10 turns.oh wait, there goes a random event and you lose 1 of each resource now and lose. again.Tried clicking the feedback button and was just taken to their socials links.Not sure leaving a comment on their Youtube page will help any.The game is unique and enjoyable, after i turned the music down a bit. because it is nice and calm but them BAM TRUMPETS AND HORNS AND then it is calm and quiet again."

A very Story Driven Game , Story is pretty solid There is actually 2 Endings to it so you can say you have to make a choice at somepoint Very Unique Game modes where you fight in 1 vs 1 against CPU in various levels Not very long game , I d say it will take like 4 Hrs to finish both the endings Overall fun and unique Price is also very fair Rating - 8/10( Great Game , Go For It )"
2198070,1,136577833,"I love this game, it is charming, it's got beautiful graphics, it has cookie you can bite I love it. It is not too in-depth like many other building games, you don't have to study through long youtube videos like many other building games but at the same time it is challenging because of the luck element. I'm in love with this game, I definitely recommend it."
2198070,1,136576244,"Graphics are awesome. The probability that cards that may be needed at that moment will come out of the deck should be increased. It's a game made by beginners. Accordingly, it's a pretty good game."

1527950,1,136581838,"Wartales is an impressive game that took me by surprise. I found myself sinking more than 110 hours into it without even noticing how much time had passed. One of the standout features for me was the ability to choose from a variety of classes to create a diverse and dynamic party. It added an element of strategy and allowed me to approach battles in different ways.Another standout feature was the warcamp, which was a unique and useful addition. It allowed me to manage resources, recruit new members, and interact with NPCs in a way that felt organic and immersive. I appreciated the option to choose between playing as a lawful character or embracing a more criminal lifestyle, which added a layer of moral complexity to the game.Overall, Wartales is a fantastic game that offers a rich and satisfying experience. Its unique features and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for fans of strategy and RPG games."
1527950,1,136580888,"super fun so far. movement around the map could definitely be improved. if you click on a spot for your party to go, they try to go in a straight line, and almost always get caught on terrain. other that that, i'm absolutely loving it. the freedom to do what you want, party management, camp building...all fantastic so far. if you like the idea of medieval x-com type gameplay, definitely give this a try."
2194400,1,130409958,"A great game, its so fun"
1527950,1,136579806,All I can say is that a game can't get much better than this.Well done Shiro Games!
1527950,1,136580469,Good game. Congrats on the release!
1527950,1,136579900,Great game!
1527950,1,136578763,"Similar to Battle Brothers with similar yet different mechanics and graphics, enough that i would say the game feels different while being of the same genre. I would say this game is slightly easier at the moment especially since BB has monsters that can woop you if you are not careful, developer seems to be trying to make game harder tough which sounds dope. I honestly don't have any bad things to say about the game so far its got a good combo going between the management and fighting aspects. 9/10 would buy again"
1527950,1,136577069,"Excellent RPG game with management elements. Some mechanics may be difficult to understand at first, but they become clear as you progress through the game. The graphics are excellent, and I'm currently playing it in co-op with just one other person, which makes managing the camp and characters a bit easier."
1527950,1,136577595,This game expertly manages RPG/Exploration/Character-building and is continually improving. The Devs are open to ideas and interact with the community.
1527950,0,136576847,"I'm really on the fence about this game. When I got it as the very early and incomplete version, it was awesome, arguably the best \"tactical RPG\" I know, even devoid of many features. But, as the versions progressed and the changes were made, it became worse. Today, probably hours away from release, it's... just another tRPG, I guess. With a couple interesting ideas and a number of annoying problems, just like most games.The changes themselves are quite subtle. (sorry for long explanations, it's fairly intuitive when you actually play).As an example, there is a very nice implementation of turn order: both your and your opponents' men are \"distributed evenly\" in the turn order for the round, so if the number of combatants is equal, you and enemy take turns acting with a single fighter, until all fighters act. However, for the AI, the order of its units acting is fixed, while you can act with any of your guys (who didn't act in this turn yet). While \"unfair\" towards the AI, it provides many interesting choices and tactics.Now, if the enemy has twice as many people as you do, for each of your actions, they make two. So, even if you kill (or otherwise deal with) the guy who acts next (the obvious choice), another enemy will act after that and probably you'll be in some trouble. So, the difference in numbers turns out to be very, very important.What did they change? Now, the number of your enemies is always quite close to yours, and in cases it somehow isn't, the extra units will arrive later (when you already killed many enemies) as reinforcements. So, the (rightfully dreaded) experience of being outnumbered is cut off from the game. Now, a lot of battles follow the same pattern: you neutralize the enemy who acts next, then he doesn't do much (or anything at all, if killed), rinse, repeat. A hundred of perfectly forgettable battles. I could write several such examples, including camp management, economy, fog mechanics. The early versions did convey the right experiences: you struggled to stay afloat with money, thoughtfully picked your contracts, took care of your men. But the updates made the game progressively worse. My best guess is, the game designers knew what they are doing and made bold (and really good!) decisions, but then some salespeople took over the game and made it \"accessible for wider audience\" or something - just another game.UPD. The release actually happened while I was writing this. Congratulations! Despite all I wrote above, kudos for actually going all the way to the finished game, I know it's hard work."
1527950,1,135994634,"A good game, similar to Battle Brothers but definitely doing its own thing."
1527950,1,135945975,"I really like this game. It isn't really like any other game I have and which adds to its charm. It is lite Role Playing  and has some nice puzzle sections that I actually enjoy. The Combat is really enjoyable, I prefer the turn based style and building up your gang is fun. I am looking forward to another play through on full release, which I think is in the next week or so."
1527950,1,135983560,"The game play is fun and dynamic. Exactly what you want out of a turn based combat, resource management game"

1527950,1,135994422,nice
1527950,1,135942059,"Turn based RPG with layers of features. Great available classes and build variations. Amazing survival mechanics. Many types of mission/quest that does not repetitive much. Good graphics although I hope there would be more kill animation. Multiple hours of fun. However, the game is too quiet for my taste, no voice acting, but not a big deal. Limited character customization but armors and weapons are design beautifully which is fun.This game have the potential to expand into and epic game.Overall :  8.1Graphics : 8.0Story : 7.0Combat : 9.0Survival : 8.5Replayability : 8.0"

1527950,1,135929503,Do you like sending bears into combat to maul your enemies?Capturing a zombie and making him a loyal bard?Feasting on wolf sausage and sardines?Well if so...THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.

1527950,1,135926112,"Playing Wartales brings back memories of my childhood spent playing Might and Magic III. Since then, I haven't found a turn-based RPG that I enjoyed until I discovered Wartales a few months ago through YouTube videos. It's a fantastic modern successor to the Turn based RPG games from my childhood, and I absolutely love it.The developers are doing an excellent job of listening to the community and continually adding new content, which is very impressive. However, I have noticed lack of optimization issues with Nvidia, causing the game to stutter for few secs during your turn in combat. Playing in open GL mode reduces the problem, but I hope the developers add the Nvidia optimization to solve this issue.Despite this issue, I highly recommend this game at its full price, and it's worth every penny. Don't wait for a sale; get it now."
1527950,0,133339053,Game is frustrating. Grind is ridiculous. Loot is penurious. You spend most of your gold paying wages and buying food. This game is horrible
1527950,1,133331669,"Very solid game with good mechanics, one of the best games ive played recently. Keep up the good work!"
1527950,1,133315877,"A fantastic game even in Early Access.Plenty of content to keep you engaged, with over 100 locations to discover and more coming when V1.0 arrives. There's a little arena, tons of quests, little 'bosses' you can fight that once killed, drops unique and upgradable weapons, Bounties to fulfil, relationships between your companions, even arguments. Co-op is also an option if you're into that.The game keeps getting better and better every single update and it keeps me coming back to it.The only negative thing I can actually say about it is the fact that I can't decapitate people. Why am I allowed to whip my little slave men but I can't execute them.An absolutely fantastic game overall and I recommend it for people who enjoy tactical, turn-based RPGs."
1527950,1,133316502,Fun RPG turn-based game.  Developers have continued adding to the game and it gets better with every update.

1527950,1,133303935,One of the best RPG games ever!
1527950,1,133292009,"Really has potential. Really into the concept.There's so much going on in this game that I keep dumping long hours into it. Yeah, it's definitely not a fast paced game that everyone is going to enjoy. Some of the fights I've run into more early on in the game have taken long periods of time both in setup/strategy and because of the turn-based nature of the game. It'll take a couple of tries to get things right starting out and it's pretty easy to lose companions if you're not paying attention to everything that's going on.Micromanaging your wages, food and companions' relationships is challenging and rewarding, making the overall hardcore feeling of the game much more appealing for players like me. Screw up positioning and lose your favorite archer, maybe save scum a few times to try finding a better starting position. There's a lot to soak up when you first start and there's definitely a bit of a learning curve, which makes it more entertaining and challenging.Cannot wait to see where the game ends up going from here. Really enjoying what's there and I've only unlocked one other region so far, so there's plenty of stuff for me yet to do. I've tried a few groups so far and end up going back to the first one I created where I'm the furthest and in a definite money problem (though, I always forget to grab some prisoners - which is a pretty decent way to fund everything), sometimes a food issue, but my troop is getting stronger every time I sit down to rampantly play."
1527950,1,130199030,"Decent. Grab during a sale.The fact that there is no initiative and any character can move when it's your turn (and vice versa for the enemy) feels silly. The starting positions in most fights also don't make a ton of sense to me. The talent trees are too shallow and it feels like some classes are much stronger than others. The 'campaign'/story is nice, but the battles become repetitive fairly quickly. I stopped playing sometime during the third region and haven't felt like picking it up again. It's overpriced at $30, and I'd encourage nearly everyone to play Battle Brother instead, but it's worth a look if you can grab it during a sale."
1527950,1,130188531,Would I recommend Wartales...100%  Yes.Its like a D&D table top
1527950,1,130201876,Addicted
1527950,0,130154072,"Instead of devoting all time and resources to f' ing FINISHING the game, bringing-in quality-of-life fixes, FIXING THE INCREDIBLY-BROKEN PROFESSIONS, ESPECIALLY ANGLER AND SCHOLAR, and on and on and on, the development-team believes that it is more important to focus on co-op/multi-player, in a game that is entirely-designed as a single-player-game.This level-of-incompetence is, to me, unbelievable, and is what leveraged-my-decision to refund this not-very-fun game, which I probably would have done even if there was not this elephant-in-the-room issue of development-incompetence and poor direction."
1527950,1,130186860,i came into this thinking it would be a clone of Battle Brothers they do share a lot of similarity's butThis has a soul of it's own i could and will sink a lot of hours into this. I would Recommend this to any fans of Strategy RPG's It's great solo and Co-op.
1527950,1,130149997,"The basic premise of the game is that you control a changing party of mercenaries and seek your fortune in a low-fantasy open world. As this is essentially the same premise as Battle Brothers, which I'm very familiar with, I'm going to compare the two in my review. I think a lot of people who will be interested in this newer game (still EA) will have already tried Battle Brothers, so such a comparison may be helpful to them.Compared to BB, this game has a much greater sense of REALISM; every experience is more immersive. Instead of moving your party's icon across the map, you will see your group of members, complete with their beast(s) of burden and wagon(s), walking across the world itself. There are lots of points of interest in the world for you to interact with, including resource deposits to collect, groups of travelers of different factions, towns to visit, tombs to explore, etc. Most locations allow for you to search for things, sort of like a hidden object game. When you enter a town, there are multiple locations to visit, but they're a bit more involved than simply a menu with a list of options. Sometimes there are puzzles or quests involving multiple people, and in many cases you'll have to choose which faction to side with. Rather than hiring non-combat followers like BB, each of your companions can choose a profession which is very useful for the party as a whole; for example, you can designate someone to be a cook, which will enable them to cook recipes from food ingredients, and someone else to be a miner, allowing them to extract ore from mines. Most professions are associated with a mini-game; an angler has a little game in which you try to keep a fish on the line. The crafting system involves gathering resources from many sources: from town shops, from travelling merchants, from harvesting natural deposits, from skinning defeated animals; and then unlocking recipes that can be completed in your camp or in a dedicated workshop. The sheer number of things to do, and the way they all connect and benefit your team - it's a very impressive system. In terms of the fantasy element: if BB is a \"low\" fantasy world, this seems to be a \"lower\" fantasy world. If there is any sort of magic (beyond certain alchemy potions) or fantastic creatures (beyond a humongous rat) in this game, I have not discovered it yet.GRAPHICALLY, the game outshines BB in every way. All people have full 3D models; all movements, battle skills, etc. are fully animated, and they're done so very well. I'm not knocking Battle Brothers here at all; it simply focuses on gameplay and doesn't endeavor to do a whole lot graphically, and people who enjoy it aren't looking to be wowed with graphics. That said, this game does, and uses the graphics for full immersion in a very impressive way.The COMBAT is comparable to Battle Brothers, each having strengths and weaknesses. One of my favorite things about both games is that everybody can die. For real. For good. If you suck and let one of your guys die, they're dead. Gone. Bye bye. When I said your party is *changing*, that's what I meant: if you bite off more than you can chew, they'll be pushing up daisies in no time, and you'll have to recruit replacements. That said, combat in this game is *slightly* more forgiving, in that there's a mechanic applied to all your characters that essentially gives them the \"nine-lives\" perk from BB; that is, if they would be killed by a blow the first time, they survive it for a moment but will die for real if they take any more damage before they are healed. \"Healed\", meaning a realistic first aid skill that doesn't magically put them back to full health - it stops bleeding, burning, etc., and gives them a few hitpoints. A major difference between this game and BB is that battles are affected very little by RNG rolls; it rarely determines whether attacks hit or miss. (It does affect the order that enemies take their turns, as well as damage output for most skills.) Another major difference is that the tactical maps are not hex-based; they are based on realistic distances. Characters, depending on their movement ability, may be able to move up to, say, 10 meters. Positioning is very important, as different skills and weapons have different ranges (in meters). There are also natural hazards for certain tactical maps, such as falling rocks in caves, or lightning strikes during storms. (I actually find that these detract from the realism a bit, however, for two reasons: #1 in real life, they don't happen often enough to be a real factor in any battle of this size; #2, you get a preview of the AoE for these hazards before the turn, so you know exactly where and when they will occur, and you have plenty of time to get your guys out of the way.) In all, the combat feels very good in this game. I'm delighted to tell you that I screwed the pooch about 20 times before I finally figured out how to keep my guys alive.Your COMPANIONS can be recruited from inns, from prisons, or other sources, such as solving a dilemma a certain way or completing a quest. You can also take prisoners and force them to do your bidding, including even taming most animals in the game and having them fight for you. Unlike BB, they have classes rather than backgrounds; the classes determine what options are available when they level up, so the customization doesn't feel quite as flexible as BB. You cannot equip any armor/weapon on any class. Only an Archer can use a bow, and he/she can't use anything else (that I'm aware of); in the event that they are forced into a melee attack, they can only use their fist to punch for a couple points' damage. The Ranger class is essentially a \"rogue\" from most RPG-type games. They can only wield a knife and an option off-hand weapon. I'm not sure why he's called a \"ranger\", as his primary weapon is not ranged and he doesn't really have any connection to nature or animals. As far as the uniqueness of characters' appearance, there are about 5 faces, 5 hairstyles, 5 beards, 5 hair colors, etc that you can choose from. So you can customize... just not a lot. However, companions can be either male or female, though I'm not sure of the full implications of this, or if it's simply an aesthetic choice. As you progress through the game, events can happen (like in BB) where characters acquire new traits or even promotions. When you hire someone, you don't know how exactly they will end up a month down the road.PROCEDURAL GENERATION: This is the main area where BB triumphs over Wartales, as it has a fully generated, randomized world for each game. This is the main reason why I have over 4000 hours in it: it's hugely replayable. In comparison, the world of Wartales and most things in it were manually designed. RNG does affect some things from game to game, such as which items are available for sale at different locations, where/when some resources will appear, who will be travelling where and when, the order that quests will appear, etc. However, the world is otherwise a map of the same area from game to game. You can re-play the game with different characters, strategies, skills, and whatnot, and you can unlock different starting areas as you progress through the game; however, you will still be playing the same world, and you'll know all locations, stories, main quests, and decisions ahead of time, provided that you've discovered them before in an earlier playthrough. In my opinion, this is the only real drawback to this game compared with BB; but for me, it's a major one.That said, this is a very fun, high-quality game with a ton of stuff to see and do and try out. What the developers set out to do, they have achieved remarkably. And it's still only Early Access - you can bet it's only going to get better as they continue to add more of the same."
1527950,1,130143807,"this is a hidden Gem! very good so far. it is essentially a top down rpg, you do have a party but move all as one unit on the map with shared inventory so you dont have to swap between inventories of party members. the world is explored top down crpg like diablo or Wasteland and when combat is engaged it plays turn based akin to divinity with cool kill animations, and some environmental things. its got a pretty in depth crafting system and each character can have a profession they can skill up at and craft better stuff. there is also fun mini games like fishing and armor crafting and based on performance in mini game is the quality of item. it does have difficulty scaling so you can customize it to meet the level you find fun both on survival and combat elements.  party management does not feel like a chore as you find contracts to get paid to pay your merc party and can find food in wild/ hunting fishing gathering. also you can find crafting materials in world for crafting gear and cooking food. camping is fun and intuitive. all in all im having a blast and i wish i picked it up sooner. if you like the idea of a free roam top down crpg with crafting and good turn based combat that is simple yet fun this could be your new best friend. have not ran into any stability issues yet and only one small bug that was not a hindrance in any way."
1527950,1,130153060,Yes
1527950,1,130126158,"Wartales is a fun and challenging game for you or you and a friend to play. (Thanks to Co-Op) It is a true gem and I highly recommend you support this game and project. It combines RTS, RPG, Open world, and makes you think."
1527950,0,130132792,Not enough content to be worth buying at the moment
1527950,1,127064312,"Loving it so far, just got it and played it for a few hours. For a pre-release I'm impressed and not going to complain. Hope to see more from these folks."
1527950,1,127077206,Great game.
1527950,1,127031534,this game so addict event EA it still greatwhat need to improve ai right is really EA they only have one skill to use per turn compare to player which can use 1- 3 skill but it early access rightlate game when you have all of gold food it start to get bored. should have some dynamic event to make game look challenge
1527950,1,127019462,Very tactical game!
1527950,0,126967397,"There seems to be a trend going on of games that are deemed good because they are difficult. It started with Dark Souls and everyone seems to be trying it. However the difficulty of DS is self scalable and a tone setter for the game. Ware tales however is just difficult. Don't get me wrong, i enjoy a game that seriously stresses my mind. I wait with anticipation for Frostpunk 2. However when a game artificially makes its setting difficult for the sake of being difficult, no thanks...Number of points.1 Game economics are terrible. You can tell the economic capability of a game like this based of the craft cost. A crafted item should generally be worth more than the base components that went into it. This can vary if there is a price change due to quantity in a market (not for Wartales). When i went over the general prices for many crafted items, about 1/3 to 1/2 are just straight out less cost effective than their base components. This is disheartening to see at the start of a game. I didn't even factor in the general cost of acquiring the items in terms of party upkeep. You can grind the game out and make progress with the system possibly. That was just a massive red flag for me right away.2 Combat is completely unbalanced. I know, people with tell me that it was fine for them, just use strategy, or if you do it this certain way than its just fine. A game like this should reward you for thinking tactically, not demand it. I don't enjoy spending an abundant amount of time strategizing on each tedious fight. Also if you are fighting same level enemies as you, the general expectation is that their capabilities will be the same. If the enemy can do double my damage at the same level and class, that's an artificial difficulty adjustment for the sake of being difficult. I don't enjoy it, and i don't enjoy being given paltry rewards for it. At least one wound at least per encounter for me, costing me at least 20 in craft good cost for a medicine, reward worth about 15 or 20. Just disappointing after the effort.3 The story is lost in the survival. Any semblance of story that you might come across gets lost in the desperation to simply survive. You will make decisions based on your current needs more than on your morals at the start. Maybe this is the tale they are trying to convey. That life looses meaning when you stop living and just survive. Well they are right and that, in the end, is why i didn't exactly enjoy this game. I play games to live, not simply survive."
1527950,1,126981315,Good game and different difficulties makes it enjoyable even if you are really bad/good at this kind of game.
1527950,0,126962193,After playing a while gets very dull and boring.
1527950,0,126902464,"I really really like the game but most of the time you spend running back and forth, back and forth trying to get money or food to just feed your folks... I want to play to darn game but never really can because it is all about food and gold nothing else.  I understand that the gold/food is a core feature but dear lord dial it back a little bit.  I have all unlocks for gold reduction, food reduction, and repair reduction yet I ALWAYS run out of gold or food... I only have 4 companions and 2 beasts to try to keep the food consumption down but it is non-stop annoying that you are constantly running out of food, never have enough gold to buy anything from vendors really so only option is to steal and then you spend the time running from patrols.  As it sits only more hardcore players will ever play the game, dial it back slightly and you might get some additional players."
1527950,1,126933346,"Absolutely fantastic. Great mix of story, exploration, and turn-based combat. I am so hooked."
1527950,1,126891655,it's good
1527950,1,122949103,"If you like Battle Brothers, this one is similar (though not quite so hard). There is none of the RNG that can ruin your evening like in BB. The game is pretty and I've enjoyed the setting, too."
1527950,1,122943146,hyhhhhhhhhhhh
1527950,1,122930611,"Excellent game.  Tons of fun, I love the pacing and self directed adventure.  No artificial pressure or race against the clock.  It's nice to relax, explore and go on adventures.The character customization, traits, relationships and growth are a big part of the fun.I get genuinely attached to my mercenaries and feel it when they die.For Gold!  For Glory!"
1527950,1,122931993,very professional and funny game. i like it most. thank you for your effort. waiting for all of this new thing impatiently.
1527950,1,122913905,got to be one of the best played please keep updating like adding other players to map and letting you build citys castle etc.
1527950,1,122919172,Imagine not playing this game bro. Kinda cringe move tbh. Smh my head
1527950,1,122929871,good game
1527950,1,122889356,"Brilliant game and to think that it's still in early access. Great tactical turn based fights, with various party dynamics. Lots of different tasks in different areas with plenty of options open to layers. Great concept and great game."
1527950,1,122909076,"Captivating game. Didn't encounter many bugs.Feels almost complete, almost. They need to fine polish some of the components like menus and such. Nothing game breaking tho.Love it!"
1527950,1,122893688,lots of fun

1527950,0,119502070,Wish I got paid every 3 days.
1527950,1,119492306,"This game is AMAZING. It's a Early Access game yet, but for anyone that enjoys slow paced mercenary group kind of game (yes, if you like Battle Brothers you'll probably love this) this is a GEM. 60 hours into it and have only fully explored 2 of the 4 (5?) regions available until now, the other 2 are almost untouched, yes I'm taking my time to explore and grow my group but still, that's a lot of content and things to do in a EA game. I'll probably take another 60hours to finish all the content currently avaiable and wait anxiously for more. The combat is very in-depth and even in Normal it's a welcome challenge, a lot of factors to take into account because each and every encounter is different, different mini-bosses, deployment and so on. Every single fight I have to think about what I'm doing, if I rush in head on even on lower level encounter I can get a guy killed. There is a lot of skills and especializations in the game, each of them bring something new to the table and makes you adapt to each situation depending on the guys you have. Nice crafting system, altough the weapons and armours you can craft gets pretty old when you reach lvl 6 and start dropping higher level stuff. They are still very much useful nonetheless. The only complain I have is the pathing system in the world map, you get stuck a lot but it's ok. I wasn't expecting to be so hooked up on the game since is EA, but the devs made an awesome game so far. It's well worth the price if you ask me, ESPECIALLY because the devs are apparently keeping up with the roadmap with almost no delays. I wholeheartedly recommend this game, in a era of awful and shallow AAA games as well as a flood of indie companies doing mini games to stay afloat, Wartales is gigantic breath of fresh air!You like Battle Brothers? Go for it. Absolutely no brainer."
1527950,1,119501715,"Rich and beautiful tactical game with lot of creativity in making the character builds. Word of warning, though - very addictive game!"
1527950,1,119501351,A fun and entertaining game
1527950,1,119490523,"Love this. Miniature medieval villages, rolling hills and a tiny army of weary soldiers fighting against the odds. What's not to love??"
1527950,1,119489578,Very Pleasing gameplay and story telling!!
1527950,0,119483735,dog shit
1527950,0,119482055,"This game was fun but I stopped after 30+hrs until they finished it before playing more.  After latest update, the game does not load and no response from developer."
1527950,1,119481589,XCOM but better
1527950,1,116441050,"A great game but for the lingering bugs.Wartales is a turn-based combat (XCom style) squad RPG, with a solid amount of content, interesting storylines, fun and challenging gameplay.  Unfortunately, there are still several bugs that range from mildly annoying to game-breaking.  By far the worst (at least on my system) is the chance to crash the entire computer upon entering any town marketplace (happens about 25% of the time), which also often corrupts both the auto-save and manual saves from that game.  I have one campaign 15 hours in, but due to that crash and save corruption, I can no longer play it.  Incredibly frustrating.Wartales is very promising and I keep coming back to it (avoiding marketplaces as much as possible) despite the ongoing problems.  Once those are sorted out and the game is refined further, I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes one of my favorites."
1527950,1,116433916,"An in-depth fun, challenging, and well executed Squad based tactics RPG. Wartales absolutely nails what it's going for and I'm glad to be along for the ride."
1527950,1,116416682,"X-Com style combat with an RPG low fantasy open world overworld. Plenty of content in it's early access state, looking forward to seeing how this develops."

1527950,1,116381017,"Quickly became one of my favorites, Highly recommend."
1527950,1,116377748,awesome game
1527950,1,114049736,"Early access titles are usually hit or miss, and Wartales was definitely a hit.It's the classic formula of \"build up a group of mercenaries\", where you do quests, earn money, recruit more mercs and make them stronger, then use that to complete harder quests. Other games that I'd compare it to are Battle Brothers and Mount&Blade.It's not quite finished yet, and this is especially noticeable in UI/UX, some content, and balancing. However, the core systems are all there and really fun. Research and crafting is really cool, and the various progress systems (Comprendium, research, ...) are amazing in a game of this genre. Haven't encountered any bugs or crashes either. Would definitely recommend to everyone who's into turn-based combat :)"
1527950,0,114103431,"Fun, but has a few fatal flaws for me.  NPC AI is awful - they charge headlong into combat and use no tactics whatsoever; no ability to swivel camera (or if there is, they haven't mapped it out for the player); no way to re-read quests.  Not sure what the backstory is either.   needs a little work still."
1527950,1,114112026,Really love this game. Wish it could have a feature to x1.5 to x2 speed in world map
1527950,1,114052674,"much tales, such war, very turnbased."
1527950,0,114037859,"The base for a great mount and blade style table top with xcom like battles is here. Has some pretty interesting elements, however being still in early access there isn't a great deal to do in the world. personally i think the battle caps can be a bit too big, it can be a real grind when youre fighting 20 wolves and you have 20 party members etc, these battles can take half an hour and happen quite frequently after a few hours gameplay. it also means there is no real attachment to any of the characters in your band and as such, whilst there are some good foundations laid the gameplay all ends up feeling rather insipid. dont pay more than 30 dollarydoos until some major updates happen."
1527950,1,114031880,"I am not a fan of \"early access\" titles or in any way encouraging developers utilizing that payment model.  Wartales however is a very well polished game.  IMO this game is Mount and Blade but instead of first persons shooter for combat, it is turn-based.  If that peaks your interest, you will enjoy this game."
1527950,1,114047586,I'm glad I bought this game. It's tough and grim. Once the learning curve is overcome there's a lot to like if you're into Turn Based Combat. Very excited to see it develop.
1527950,1,114048357,"Absolutely loving this game. Resource management, turned based strategy, crafting etc... amazing game."
1527950,0,114030337,"running a \"new-ish\" rtx 590 build. literally randomly crashes. when it does it bricks my graphics drivers and i have to reinstall from scratch. how the F&$% does this happen?!?Wish it worked, bc it was pretty fun."
1527950,1,114015665,I'm so excited for the Multiplayer update! Great game!
1527950,0,112814994,"Its a challenge. alot of the time during turn based combat, u get 1 attack when the enemy gets 3. then they get twice as many turns as you. enjoy!"
1527950,0,112787787,"I love the idea of Wartales, but for a tactical battle RPG to be fun, the combat has to be fun, and I found it fiddly, slow and grindy. Add on top of that even fiddlier town and quest mechanics, and what you're left with is a much prettier, but much less fun version of Battle Brothers."
1527950,1,112786140,"Got the game today, i have done nothing productive all day aside from starting 3 new games to get the best party going and begin to slay everything in sight under the guise of justice. Would recommend"
1527950,1,112782729,Pretty fun.It's like Battle Brothers with better graphics and UI...and also without the unforgiving/ridiculous difficulty.
1527950,1,112791423,Good stuff worth the price tag i picked it up in a sale for 23 quid...
1527950,1,112782518,If you enjoy playing games that force you to be tacticful and have to avoid fights and take real consquences for taking risking fights. then you will enjoy this game. its just hard enough to make you struggle but not enough to overwelm you
1527950,1,112777848,"Great game and wonderful concept, I am waiting it become better and having more career and development paths."
1527950,1,112776733,"Could be an interesting game. Combat is fun and interesting.But it's too frustrating to play until they improve the save game system. You can only have one save game per run and auto-saves are not reliable since there's no telling when it's being done. The ability to have more than one save per play-through as well as auto-saves for beginning of last combat and last entrance to town would be nice.Uninstalling and will wait a year to see how it improves.Edit: Reinstalled to try the different save game setting called \"Free\" and is a lot more helpful than the default setting. Would be nice to have a Quick Save option with the \"Free save\" option like many other games that gives the save game names by the relative position in the world or something."
1527950,1,112773148,"More people gotta get this game because its incredibly well made.Developers, take some notes from Kenshi, I'd wager a lot of gameplay elements from that game will fit perfectly in this game."
1527950,1,112775536,"really have been enjoying the game good combat, progression system, quests i also like the point and click searching for items and loot in area's"
1527950,1,109836280,"Hm...  42hrs in my first playthru.  42hrs in the first area alone.  I felt like with the EA, I hit the limit with my team too quickly.  Got the hang of the whole, fight, run home, repair, eat, fight, run home, repair, eat, etc. fairly quickly.As ambitious the concept of Wartales sounds like, I couldn't really feel emotionally attached to my team/character as I would in games like Kenshi, Mount & Blade, Crusader Kings, etc.  I didn't really feel attached to the mini-stories around the area as well.  I was excited to play the story of farmers wanting more with life but once I started playing, it felt like your backstory has nothing to do with how you play or how it dictates the world.  A game title like \"Wartales\" feels like a \"Play the way you want to with the backstory you want\" type game.  But this is just purely, fight, loot, repair, eat, sleep, repeat.Oh, uhm.. once I figured out how to effectively and efficiently craft items for trade, it added an additional 10hrs of gameplay of renewed excitement realizing I could make more money by crafting from random loot and selling the crafted items. But then I hit my limit again once I managed to consistently stay over 1000 gold or so.After all that and completing the first area and moving to the second, I felt like I hit a wall to play this game as it felt it's a rinse and repeat regardless of the region you're in or the background of your team.Overall, this EA reminds me of other EAs I played where I play for a solid week or two and then hit a hard stop for many years as it just didn't feel wholesome or satisfying.  I guess I'll keep TRYING to play a bit more to see what else I can uncover..I don't really thumbs down games but would definitely give this game a \"MEH\" for now.Maybe other users have a more fulfilling and exhilarating experience instead?"
1527950,1,109862139,"Developers that are listening to their players!!! Well I never :DHope that game will be finished soon, but even in an early access is a good one."
1527950,1,109866328,fun game
1527950,1,109828559,"Entertaining.  Gets compared to Battle Brothers, but it is only that in the idea that you are a mercenary band.  Combats are a bit slower, but give more/different options.  The map is great, the stories are great, the combat is good, and the troop management is good.  Lots and lots of variety in builds and capabilities of different weapons.  Each region has an underlying story and decisions you can make to find your spot in the world.There are still a few rough edges (it is Early Access), but I haven't noticed any bugs and it is still pretty darn fun."
1527950,1,109831758,Pet wolves
1527950,1,109833001,sexy game
1527950,1,109814963,"The game is hard but its alot of fun, maybe get more tutorials on classes and the fact that the player can choose what fighter goes first. Instead of thinking they cant switch, OFC the ability to move your fighters around is obvious but personally i didnt know you could switch fighters at will at the start of combat AND during combat aslong as they havent spent their action. Until i had played the game for a little while. Personally i think there should be a more \" DND \" aspect to the game where the initiative during combat will be based on skill \"and/or dice\" if you decide to implement that in the game.Running on the world map should be a basic skill that you shouldnt have to spend points on in my opinion, because the fighters are grown ass men and women :P I also think that the cooking and the raw material production in camp should be increased to maybe 3 - 5 per rest, at least for a time when you start the game. Some paths in the game / on the world map, was pretty wierd to be honest :P SPOILERS AHEAD !!!! When you go on the mission to kill the colonel alex or (insert name). There should be a tutorial or atleast a hint that the player can plant a piton from their inventory manually. Also the mission to go into the ancient tomb or crypt, I only found the path to the place because i saw some random NPC's running in a wierd way down the hill :P but the torch \"preperation hint\" was good :) All in all, thats my look at the game so far, i like it and i hope it has a bright future :)"
1527950,1,109824597,"Very addictive indeed, recommend for people who likes to build your own army in a anyway open world"
1527950,1,109791389,"This is an uncut Gem a little bit of polishing and would make it a Great game, worth buying if into this genre and the Devs are active with patching."
1527950,1,109790869,I see a lot of potential in this game :O!Keep up the good work devs!As of now 9/10
1527950,1,107265372,"so this is one of those games that you will restart 3 or 4 timesthere are so many parts of this game that are not explained you have to learn as you play... hence the reason to restart so many timesbut........... after you finally get how to play and keep your gear, weight, food and everything else in check, you will find yourself still playing at 5 oclock in the morninga massive fun game still in EA and if the devs keep up the good work, this game will be an epic classic foreverI love it and I would type more about this game but my team of warriors are waiting for me and we have to get back to the adventuretwo huge thumbs up"
1527950,1,107251158,"Wartales really scratches an itch for turn based RPG combat.  It's still Early Access, so some features are still being added or tweaked, but I think the core gameplay is solid enough to justify the price.  Art direction looks great, the combat is satisfying and mostly intuitive, and the setting feels alive and interesting."
1527950,1,107266367,Reminds me of Darklands
1527950,1,107194722,"I buy a few new games this time of year, the sales, but this one deserves mention. It's stand out in many ways, it's a survival sim, as well as very immersive RPG. You are a band of deserters, bandits with the potential to become unwanted...or ??, or just some farm boys out for fun, that's just 3 of the 5 starting bands of 4. In the end you are mercs or bandits, or a trader, you can even be a cannibal with a pack of hogs you feed instead of regular folks. The game is very open, with lots of side quests, so much so that I don't want to spoil it as it's so new and so many are finding new ways to survive and explore. The devs also have a strong rep, and have produced some very good games, so looking forward to more content. Right now there are 3 provinces I have found,  trade is possible between them, but you will need to protect you goods. Another good money maker is bounty hunting, take prisoners and sell them, but there us a limit. The game is pretty well balanced and does not play like an EA at all, other than lacking voice actors it's pretty polished, the world is quite immersive with each province having it's own main story line....I think they all tie together, trade control seems to be a main motive? I have yet encounter any real bugs, though sometime I think i have, you can only sell bandits as prisoners...not the innocent folks you bash over the head and force into slavery because you are to cheap to buy another pony....but you will have to feed them. It's deep, and the turn based combat is too, like chess, skill and fore thought are required. in short BUY IT, best new game of the season. The only thing lacking is more provinces, and PvP, there is already an arena you can fight NPCs in so really hoping that becomes a PvP thing...with a full loot option of course, maybe even some Pvp provinces? Who knows? These devs have proven they can deliver what we want, the newest \"happiness patch\" makes the games so much better right off, that was direct and quick response to player feed back."
1527950,1,107184003,"THIS GAME IS SO GOOD SO FAR. Great squad mechanics and though the combat does feel grueling at some points its never 'annoyingly slow' (might b nice to have the option to skip enemy combat animations and/or allied ones). Trade system is good, the difficulty of enemies with leveling is nice as I've had companions die but it has been nowhere near a common occurence (on Normal difficulty). Quests are fun, storylines are exciting, I'm vaguely addicted to how fun this game has been and... -- I'm excited to see all this game can/will hold"
1527950,1,107208016,"Really good concept and it plays very well with few crashes, basically a combination of m&b warband, Dragon age origins and XCOM. Very reminiscent of D&D 5e..."
1527950,1,107188143,10/10 FANTASTIC GAME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE FIRST COUPLE OF PEOPLE YOU LOSE AND KEEP ON TRUCKING
1527950,1,107179864,Great game for people that like strategy. Cannot wait until full release!
1527950,1,107169750,great game cant wait to see what they do during the rest of development
1527950,1,107159985,"Awesome game, recommend!"
1527950,0,105782346,"BLUF: too expensive for what is offering right now, Will come back to this review once there are enough updates to have mid and late game content.EDIT: Tutorial and tooltips have been added in the Comunity patch for December 2021. Once the autoleveling is addressed too, they will have my thumbsupIt's true. You currently have a lot of gameplay due the big map it already includes. You will really enjoy the early game once you have finished struggling figuring out how everything works, because it's not only there is no tutorial at all, it's that they have not even included tooltips or explanations for all the minigames involving crafting. And this is one of the cons I see in this game. It doesn't give you any feedback, you don't know any details about the character classes, which weapons they may use or what abilities will be unlocked when promoting one of your companions to captain or lieutenant. First times you promote someone it‚Äôs a guess game adventure, like getting a new crafting recipe for a weapon (no, brutes can‚Äôt use axes‚Ä¶ seriously?).The other big reason to not recommend Wartale right now there is no mid or late game content. You can only advance until level 5 and, after that, your companions will randomly get skill points whenever they get a nickname (it may occur several times for the same one and, guess what, the game doesn‚Äôt explain why or when nicknames are earned or changed). The only thing that escalates the game is the autoleveling of all the enemies around, which is only useful to generate more of the same with the difference that you will get combats of half an hour or 1 hour instead of the aprox 15 minutes during the early game. Spending almost one hour fighting superboars over and over again in epic battles is not fun, it‚Äôs repetitive and boring.Nevertheless, there are around 10-15 hours of early game quite enjoyable and fun (learning process included). You should do the math if that‚Äôs worth 35 ‚Ç¨ EA for you‚Ä¶ But do it in advance, by the time you have learned the game and have passed the exciting first date and start facing reality (the repetition of endless battles), you will not be eligible for a steam refund anymore."
1527950,1,105782696,Great game if you like such games. :)) Hope to see nice updates!
1527950,1,105779953,hard as hell but alot of fun
1527950,1,105777625,Great game with lots of small gameplay components that you might not notice right off the bat.  The only drawback is the current max level which stops at 5.  I just wish they would at least let you keep levelling even though you wouldn't have access to the perks.  It feels weird to keep playing through 2 other regions when you're not getting any progress on your character.
1527950,1,105776012,battle brothers but better. the happiness system needs work but other than that its a ton of fun
1527950,1,105777954,I love this game and I'm really excited for upcoming contents :D Price is worth the game
1527950,1,105779645,Enemy NPC match with player lvl is suck. Plz change it
1527950,1,105762580,"Truly and amazing Early Access - i just wished I knew i will sink so much into this game, haven't played so much for more than 10 years and now I`m afraid I finished it. Hard to explain, because if you look at this, the graphs are quite bad, the story itself is very rudimentary, mechanics not truly amazing - so all these characteristics that other games have more or less. And still this game is soo amazing overall, hard to explain. I just hope they don't polish it too much. Big thumps up."

1527950,1,105373058,"I don't often write a review but this game deserves recognition.Superb game, even in early access. So much to do with so many combinations to play with. I've only played being a noble group of mercenaries, doing contracts etc, everything from killing bandits to finding items and it can be totally unforgiving if your not careful. You have the option to play it safe or get stuck in to the heavy opponents, just make sure your geared for it haha. It's also clear that you can choose to be a sneaky group of bandits a pray on unsuspecting caravans etc. Love it. Well done.Can't wait to see what content you bring out for this."
1527950,1,105373284,"A really solid base of a game, looking forward to what more they add to it. I'm hoping for more class options, and more classes in general."

1527950,1,105371598,"Early Access but already a classic. Immersive graphics and fun mechanics. You fall in love with your team.... but surviving and keeping them alive & happy is no easy feat. Mount & Blade meets Battle Brothers. Clean, crisp, can't stop.  The more I play the more I fall in love with this game. This is now one of the top 5 games in my library. Simply superb! Bring on more content please."
1527950,1,105370988,"Incredible Game, literally can't get enough of it. Lovingly crafted - intricate and tragic stories to experience. Still a few bugs to work out - and would love some customization (e.g. some way to refresh recruits - get skills in the beginning). Loving it so far."
1527950,1,105062650,"Very fun to play this game , many quest , many thing to do , very deep play style"
1527950,1,105064574,It's like Battle Brothers but if Battle Brothers wasn't dog shit
1527950,1,105064702,Strongly recommended! You'll have fun playing this.
1527950,1,105064131,just the game i was looking for.
1527950,1,105062716,Nice
1527950,1,105060358,"Looking for an alternative to battle brothers? You found it!I will say combat in this is worse than in battle brothers, but that might change in the future. I have played the demo before early access and things have changed for the better already so I am confident they can find a way to make this game even better than it already is.EDIT: After going back to some Battle Brothers...Wartales has better combat imo. Cause it has no RNG. After such a long time of gaming and having played mainly chivalry and mordhau the last years I just can't stand these RNG systems anymore. So if you are annoyed at the RNG of battle brothers (ala XCOM) then you can safely get Wartales."
1527950,1,105060650,"its a good gameits a sandbox mercenary group game with turn based combatits fun and exciting and has a lot of potential for those who like the genrecombat animation are cool and skills are interestingcombat feels like your trying to solve a puzzlei think i could sink a lot more hours into thisPrice could be cheaperif your a fan of battle brothers \"auto buy\" but do consider the price tag for the time beingApproved for an early access game"
1527950,1,105060764,"A game with huge potential which is also very fun in the current state. It is obviously not a very big prio, but this game could use some optimization and QoL things to make things smoother, but I'm sure it will come with time.Even in the current state (early access just released) I can wholeheartedly recommend it."
1527950,1,105060687,"Wartales is a really good game amazing art style, as i go on the game only gets better. Would defiantly suggest getting this game."

2103530,1,136581288,"Let me get something out of the way: This game is in early access. It is running, it has some flaws and needs some features.  Now to the review: The game is good. It is a lot of fun. It is basically Melvor Idle with MMO aspects. You can trade with players, you have clans, you can chat ingame. This game is a lot of fun once you get into it and start understanding the full extend. (So after 5h when you need that long) YES there is a premium you can buy for 10$ once. There are other boosts you can buy, that are for X hours. But development and server costs should be accounted for by something I would say.  The Discord is very active, a lot of helpfull people are there. The Discord is the main communication tool for the game and I suggest it for every player.  Other from that? A fun game. It is basically Melvor Idle in MMO. If you like it because of that, is up to you."
2103530,1,136580398,"I understand people's complaints with this game but you have to keep in mind it's super - like this year new. I think it's got great potential because of the multiplayer aspect, my clan is one of the top 10 in the game right now but I'm having more fun playing an idle game WITH people than I ever had with single player ones. Bear in mind I'm a mmo and idle game addict so this does just kinda slot right into my niche but it's still fun and has a good future if the dev continues improving it. Notic how I said \"dev\" and not \"devs\" - from what I've seen it's all one dude making this game"
2189970,1,136581274,Ok for a free game. But very basic and bare bone with tons of missing features expected from modern and advanced factory games.
1409300,1,136579608,"Overall, I‚Äôd call Rendezvous a decent effort. It is by no means a bad game ‚Äì its cyberpunk Indonesia is well-crafted and lovely to look at, and the retro visuals work surprisingly well with the setting‚Äôs neon lights and vivid colors. The gameplay is mostly fine, too: some combat-related frustrations aside, I had fun playing detective, solving cool puzzles and sneaking around as I looked for answers and appreciated all the little details of the setting. However, what ultimately prevents me from giving this one a strong recommendation is the underdeveloped and clich√©-ridden story, the generally poorly written dialogue and the inconclusive, unsatisfying ending that all hold the project back from reaching its full potential.For more honest indie game reviews, check out our Curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6481290-GTOGG/"

I've only gone through the game once and that took about 7 hours. There are a few bugs and several grammatical errors as well as missing words on occasion, but it's not too terrible. I'm looking forward to the release of the next parts in this story. It's all very interesting so I do happily recommend it."

[b]no move limit or rating system[/b], just wreak havoc and move on. the enemy usually also has an arsenal and they're on the same 'timer' that can and should be used to your advantage, along with the game's self-admitted 'not necessarily realistic' physics. it's worth noting that enemy units only activate if there's something to shoot at (they're not bothered by your ballistas because triggering those would destroy their own things) and [b]your goal is to destroy enemy castles, but no problem if other stuff gets demolished too[/b]. maybe those tall towers with red flags are a third party and acceptable collateral damage.I figured with new additions introduced so often, most levels would feel like tutorials, but of course accumulated knowledge has to be used on later puzzles with more and more things, so it's not all a breeze, not for me anyway, and not that much filler either. [b]a puzzle skip option would be nice[/b], so if you get stuck, you're not stuck for good, though somebody's bound to make a guide at some point. level 17 caused the first real problem for me, had to sleep on it, and there were tricky situations later on as well, clever little thing. I gave up on level 30 for now, will try again if they fix the camera, look at this zoomed-in nonsense.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961080510I really like the presentation but [b]wouldn't mind weather toggles[/b] (clouds, falling snow). no on-screen level numbers ever is always a shame, here it's only on the level select screen. settings are okay and also available while playing, resolutions, windowed mode, languages, graphics quality, an all-important [b]screen shake toggle[/b], and only a single volume slider because [b]there is no music[/b]. surely kevin macleod, composer of all royalty-free music in the world, has some medieval stuff. unfortunately, [b]progress is stored in the registry[/b], which isn't covered by cloud support.it's [b]fun and satisfying, watching things fall apart[/b] (as long as it's not your own life), the [b]level editor with workshop support[/b] might provide longevity if the game gains popularity, and there's even a slight educational element, at least there was for me. catapult, trebuchet, same same, but not anymore. if controls and the camera got some love (it should be 100% mousable and non-qwerty-friendly), it'd be even better, until then it's [b]only recommended on sale[/b]."

Very eager to get back to this, and shout out to Frogwares for putting this together in the middle of a war!"

2156300,1,136584681,"For my first actual dating sim game, I thoroughly enjoyed this! Got really invested in the story to see what was happening next, great writing with some great humour (loved the pigeon dialogue)! Can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes next!The visuals too‚Ä¶ wow. Fantastic models and renders! Roll on Episode 2!"
2285400,0,136584668,"Nope. This is insanely buggy. Couldn't start a game after getting through the 'tutorial' which is nothing more than a sequence of screenshots outside the game. Basically a man page. Not to mention you can't click on anything in the main window, and it completely destroys your multi-monitor layout, moving windows around randomly, resizing stuff and all sorts. Just no. Seems to be completely untested so don't bother with it."
1772830,1,136583040,"This review is written being around 1:30h into the game. I never write reviews until Im done with a game but oh god does this  game feel great. I've been a fan of the metroidvania genre since I played Zero Mission on the gba, we were a bit scrapped for titles for a few years and i was left replaying the older castlevania games mostly. Then came Hollow knight, and absolute masterpiece that reignited my love for the genre like never before and showed a level of care, love and brilliance I'd never seen among it's peers.Since then I've been feeling that itch every few months, a nothing that came out could quite scratch it; Hollow knight inspired games that didn't quite hit the spot and felt just serviceable. Games that might have good exploration, combat or movement but didn't quite bring it all together in my experience. This game is doing it: I'ts fresh, innovative, well designed and above all, it gives you tools to be extremely creative in how you play any given situation. The hook is not a gimmick like in some other games, it's momentum based and a core element of how you're supposed to traverse levels and approach combat, you can even hook enemies that tend to stay away to blast them with your guns. Plot seems interesting, it starts in media res and you start learning about the world characters and your background as you go. Music is good, art is great and the level design seems outstanding. I'll update this when I finish the game, but for now I say: If you're a fan of this genre and you're on the fence about this, just give it a chance, it deserves it."
2216700,1,136584839,nice story writing solid graphics and music with great roguelite mechanics its really pleasing so farim sure veterans of the genre will be pleased
1772830,1,136585857,Played the demo a while ago and the game did not disappoint very very very very good game
1772830,1,136586644,This game is super!!
1811990,1,136586283,"I absolutely adore this game already! Its engaging and consistently difficult, but it hardly feels impossible. I've not yet won a run, with only a few making it past the first boss, but I don't feel frustrated or like i'm making no progress. Not to mention how cute the art style is! This is definitely a game i'm personally gonna sink a lot of hours into and I can't wait to see how it and the community grows!"
1811990,1,136586353,"This is an excellent game, put a ton of hours in to the pre release demo. Just know that this is a progression based game, youre absolutely going to need to unlock items in the village to consistently move forward, you *will die* on your first runs. youre not going to luck into a full game completion, thats now how this is balanced."
1811990,1,136586434,"Very polished, very clean entry in the genre. More streamlined than Slay the Spire or Monster Train, and thus a little simpler, but still very engaging and satisfying. Lots of progression and unlockables. Highly recommend."

1811990,1,136585898,"I was wanting a tougher roguelite deckbuilder and Wildfrost delivers that, with a beautiful artstyle and excellent sound design, so far I have no issues with the difficulty but after more hours I will come back and update this review."
1811990,1,136586059,"Fantastic so far, definitely has a difficulty curve would advise ignoring people whining about difficulty it's clearly a game that requires some time to master."
1811990,1,136586275,Refreshing and difficult (in a good way!)
1811990,1,136585205,"aint no way every single bad review is a skill issue problem üíÄüíÄ. their are a few cards in this game that did not have an \"attacks allies too\" (which imo is a skill issue) and sometimes you will try out a different strategy that relies on turn order that may not work (like an enemy that attacks from, the backlines), but it all comes through experience.  but other than that, this is an great adaptation to slay the spire. 8/10 music, visuals are actually insane, the more i look into the game the more visuals i notice. ayo balance your pets though, some pets are absolutely useless lol. i do love how challenge it is, this way you cant just speedrun your way through the game, and the implications of strategy are just as deep as slay the spire in its own unique way"

If you are fans of Ghost Recon: Phantoms or the Old SOCOM games, you NEED to try this one out! It's completely free!Video Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqzr2Xob1R0Pros- Almost 70 Operators to Choose from, leading to huge gameplay shifts between matches- Visuals look awesome on Characters, Maps and Weapons- Both PVP and PVE modes (PVE in co-op too) so it has something for everyone!- Map design is simple, but allows for traversal of a few different flank routes- No longer P2W, with the vast majority of Monetization Options tied to Cosmetics and Emotes- Developers who Actually listen to player feedbackCons- There is still a lot of Monetization Options, which get confusing looking through all of the menus- Operator Balancing still needs a bit of work (Explosive Flying Drones and Invulnerable Operators need nerfing)- The time between Battle Passes makes it impossible to get certain Operators without waiting until the next Pass, which may not be for a month or two. Just make them back to back like EVERY. OTHER. GAME. EVER. So we can then get the last season Ops sooner. Weird choice."
307950,1,136586095,Rogue Company meets Arma. As close to Socom on PC as youre going to get.
307950,0,136585148,I love the game and will continue playing it because it brings back the old school Socom/Tom Clancy days but the problem at the moment for Australian players is there's no servers for us not even an Asia server to jump in. This results in 300 ping games and while I can deal with it and have some fun not everyone else will be willing to do the same. I wouldn't even bother asking anyone to download and play it with me because no one will say yes to 300 ping games. Add Asia/Oceania servers if you want these regions to play your game.
307950,1,136585011,Fun game! I have been playing the game before it came to steam. I hope more players pick this up.

307950,1,136584373,Good Game !
307950,1,136583210,I have played for over 150 hours on the standalone client before the game came to steam. Highly recommend Caliber if ur a fan of third person shooters or tactical shooter in general.
2133870,1,136582525,"Easily one of the best indie golf games I've played. -tight and simple controls -a power up system that never feels overpowered and has fair cool down system so you can't spam things-stats balance fairly and noticeably change your swing so you can't just pump everything into drive to cheese the game like what happens with so many other indie golf games that try to add Mario Golf GBC/GBA's rpg mechanics-courses feel really carefully planned and the stage hazards really keep things fresh as your stats grow-excellent music-the challenges in single player offer a lot of varietyHonestly, this game is a better Mario Golf than Mario Golf Super Rush is."
2094270,1,136583426,"This was certainly a fascinating experience. The dialogue could get a little esoteric at times, but otherwise the story is great and I cannot wait to see what the next few chapters have in store for us."
2198070,0,136584535,"This game is not entertaining at all. UI is problematic. First of all, there should be some kind of tutorial at the begining to tell me what the heck is going on. Secondly, I guess something is happening at the game as you play, like earthquakes, and buildings being destroyed like its nothing. There is no animation of these buildings collapsing at all, that it seems like a bug.Anyways, this is still an early access game, so I could give another chance when it is completely done."
2198070,1,136586209,"Reminds me of \"Isle of Arrows\" which I also liked a lot. But I found it way harder due to having multiple resources."
2198070,1,136586923,Cute game with very a original premise. Definetly worth a try :P

1795470,1,136584908,"Okay so while this game might not look like much because of its pixelated graphics. That's actually a good thing.This game is legit. I can't sing it's praises enough.Is it next gen? NahIs it something you can't miss? Nah.But you would still be doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out.You're island shrinks slowly but surely and you needed to accomplish enough objectives so you can move on to the next island, rinse and repeat. Now while it sounds simple and hell...the gameplay is pretty simple for the most part. The game is so well made that I can't get mad at it.It's addictive, it's engaging, it's mysterious, it's challenging (But in a good way) and overall it's just really fun.Probably 6-12 hours of gameplay here (depending on how much you wanna play or accomplish) and for 13 dollars, this kind of gameplay and stability it's a great offer.I Highly recommend this game and even if this isn't normally your type of game I'd still recommend you check it out. It's a resource gathering, upgrade buildings and build up defenses against pirates kinda game. It plays really well, has a decent tutorial and a decent story with everything else about this game being almost perfect for what kind of game it is.But if that still wasn't enough then please check out the video on my YouTube channel (link below) for a more in depth look at the game.Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9cqUYS22us"
1795470,1,136583424,"I just finished my first playthrough - saw the first 4 levels of the campaign (out of the 12 total) and 2 biomes (out of 6). What I really like about this game is the aesthetics and the unique gamplay idea. Each island you're on gets gradually flooded, which means that you have less space to build and need to be smart about building placement. Biomes have different features, so you have to adjust your strategy to individual conditions. You also get different commanders and relics (items) that help you with the challenge. The screen may sometimes get crowded and with many buildings on the island you may need to pay extra attention when moving around, but other than that it's a really fun an enjoyable game! Also, there are 2 modes other than campaign available, but I haven't tried them yet."
2321460,1,136584912,"It's got a nice aesthetic to it with the obvious Hotline Miami vibes.The microchip puzzle mechanic of it is nice, in the original demo you would cut microchips and append them to devices, but in this one there's more of that feeling of taking the plastic face off of a device and undoing its many layers of computer parts to find the one broken with in, it has room for improvement but the meat of a good game is all right there.It's got a strong foundation and a nice Papers Please feel to it. Hope this game goes places.It's very story driven, which isn't a slight but I do hope thats a product of the demo, and in the final product there will be more... mundane store stuff.overall a pretty cozy game about running a repair shop with a killer soundtrack.One of the characters says that the main character should open a coffee shop.. not a bad idea for a game of this nature."
2354600,1,136582660,"Really enjoying this game so far. The game play loop is really addictive, the visuals are beautiful, and it plays really smooth. I'm a big Hotline Miami and Nuclear Throne fan and I'm getting those vibes so far. Definitely worth spending the five bucks and I haven't even seen the movie."

1527950,1,136586726,"Wartales (finally emerging from Early Access today) is a 3D spiritual successor the Battle Brothers. The premise is similar, you start as a small ragtag band of mercenaries where the only goal is to continue surviving. To do so you must manage your resources like food, money, healing potions, etc. to ensure you can keep surviving.  Battles take place in tactical turn-based style.Pro's- The combat is refreshingly strategic. Your characters don't have an \"order\" they go in, you get to choose which character takes actions in what order (each character goes once per \"round\"). You can have wild swings when you play correctly, or lose a companion if you plan poorly.- The world is well crafted and I particularly like the idea they used with Pitons... essentially you can tie ropes down from steep ledges which can serve as short cuts in the future. More ability to influence the world would be great, but it's a small thing you never got with Battle Brothers.-Professions - Each character can specialize in a \"side job\". This is similar to how Battle brothers allowed you to have skills with non-combat mercs, except now they are tied to your mercs. Some are a bit silly (woodchopping? really?) but I like how these skills are used and breath a bit more life in to your mercs.Neutrals- Region Quests - I really like how each region essentially has a unique \"main questline\" to follow. I think it adds life to the world and allows for you to make decisions on what type of mercenary party you want to be. The reason this is in Neutral is because the execution struggles to deliver in most regions. You can do some of the events out of order (which is fine by itself) however you often miss the backstory on what is happening. For instance, in one region, the quest line is essentially \"Lord A is at war with Lord B\" and that's it. You can do a variety of things to assist one side or the other, but the greater narrative is lacking. Why did they go to war? Why should I support one or the other? Just having an NPC in the town you can get information from would be a great addition.Con's- Combat can be a lengthy experience. If you have a large party (which is encouraged but not required) you will only go up against large parties. I have 13 active companions and will regularly go up against 16 enemies. This makes for long rounds (4 rounds is about average for combat). Especially if it's combat that isn't particularly engaging (wild animals) you can get bogged down. This is especially challenging if you have limited play time.- Difficulty - So this isn't Battle Brothers. Anyone used to tactical turn based combat is going to find \"normal\" difficulty fairly easy. This isn't the negative though, the negative is the implementation of difficulty scaling. You get the option at the beginning to chose Dynamic Scaling (no matter where you go, you will always face approx the same difficulty of enemies) or Region Locked (each region has a set difficulty). My complaint is that trying to implement BOTH of these has resulted in neither being well done. Dynamic Scaling completely takes away any sense of accomplishment or progress. Now I have to fight 18 wolves instead of 5.... while region locking can force grinding to progress. Personally, I highly recommend Region Locked.Overall, I am greatly enjoying the game and highly recommend it. This is a starting point. Battle Brothers took years to get to the state it's in now and I think Wartales has a similarly strong foundation to continue adding content and addressing weakness."
1527950,1,136585922,Now I can finally play the damn game and beat it till the end!  Amazing game
1527950,1,136586739,"This game is fun , give it a try . GL"
1527950,1,136584147,"I played it in early access : Wartales became one of my favorite games. While one could criticise the lack of some equipment (helmets) and sometimes balance issues, you can't deny there is a feeling of adventure in there. You will have to explore a lot, fight a lot, do not starve, go hunting, fishing, mining, stealing, try to find your path. You may take a bandit as a prisonner, and then free him; or whip him to death; or kiss him; or make him your captain; or cut him in pieces and eat him; or perhaps all of these ? I'll give it a tryA lot of options to customize your party, builds and gear, your overall gameplay with more challenging difficulties and starting areas. I like the graphics, the storytelling, the minigames (best of all is the Rouste !!), the way you have to think ahead to build your group as a whole with professions (WHAAATT ? A BARD ??? Yes, my lord, a bard, what song do you want ?).Shiro Games is a company based in my town, I think someday I'll go visit them and pay them my thanks (with a bottle of Edoran wine) for giving me 142,1 hours of good time so far"
1527950,1,136585662,Very fun game. Hits a similar vibe as battle brothers but is a lot less random and more strategic.It also has many more 'realism' elements than battle brothers does.Enjoying it so far.
1527950,1,136584444,Its X-Com but with more features and less pressure set in Medival. Did I mention it was cheaper?*Sad AAA Dev noises
1527950,1,136583884,"Short: An absolute joy.Long: I made my own band of mischiefs. Got beaten up, chased and hated. Came in to some money, some ale and slave chains.

1934040,0,136586205,Well I would reallllyy want to give a positive but not at the moment of writing this review. The game is lacking and in terms of resources it is way too unbalanced. I am not gonna lie I love the game and all but don't buy it for now wait a bit for content update or when they are gonna be on sale.

Don't even get me started about the loading screens....I could literally drink an entire cup of coffee at my leisure.  I DO recommend this game after they have done a lot of work on it as it WILL be a great game at THAT time.  Right now I would hold off until they put some hours into fixing/improving it.   This game does have great potential.  I mean I played the demo and it was a blast although I did have a few issues, but it's like the release version went backwards.  Even though i'm rather disappointed, I will be keeping my eye on this one and would love to repurchase it later."

2109430,1,136588490,"Its worth your money and support to a wonderful studio. I loved the characters and the story, and wanted to play through this story to get every little detail and outcome. However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder. To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.  The music was top notch, and the story had me so involved I wished the puzzles were not in the game. overall worth it and I hope to give it another go in a couple days."
2109430,1,136586169,"I love this game. It's just a fantastic story/experience. It's great if you've seen the movies, but you really don't need to watch them to enjoy it. Definitely the best game I've played this year. One of a few games I would recommend to anyone."
2109430,1,136585876,"I'm a huge fan of Tron and I really couldn't believe my eyes when this new game was unveiled at D23 Expo right before my eyes. Fast forward to April 2023: I'm downloading, playing and soaking the game in. It does a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere and vibe of The Grid. The story is captivating and the puzzles in between are a nice change. Oh and the visuals with the music... I could just stare at them for hours!It is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.Also, they are working on more Tron projects and I am totally here for the ride! End of line."
2109430,1,136585702,"Pretty cool detective visual novel! This is a game where your decisions matter, and where you always question whether you made the right choice or not. It's pretty short so you can do multiple playthroughs to see what happens if you choose differently.I'm not super familiar with the Tron universe, so some of the lore is lost on me, but I feel like it made it even better for me.  I didn't know who to trust or what to believe, or who was aligned with whom, but the game does a good job at explaining things and giving context, so I never felt lost or overwhelmed. The writing is good, the visuals are great, the music gives a cool vibe.Overall, if you like visual novels, this is a safe purchase and a good experience."
2109430,1,136586063,"Such a fun game with an interesting story. Never played a visual novel type game till now and I know it won't be the last. I had a blast going after all sections of the game and getting all the achievements! Bithell Games, thank you for making this masterpiece of a Tron game."
1498040,1,136586055,Really good stuff here. Lots of unlocks but no meta progression otherwise. Although I prefer meta progression the style of unlocks here work well in place of it. This is one of the peaks of this style of game.  I highly recommend.
1772830,0,136588107,Looks great plays like shit.
1469540,1,136587922,"Believe it or not, I've been waiting a long time for this game. I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], and I enjoyed the mobile game <Maximus 1>, <Super Boys - The Big Fight> and <Black Moor 2> a lot.First of all, it's so good that this game was released on Steam itself, but it seems like it needs constant updates like someone else's opinion. Even if this game doesn't have a point store, I'd like to at least have an achievements or trading card. Also, the full screen didn't apply, so I felt awkward while playing... I agree with others.In other words, I've been waiting for the release of this game for quite a long time, but I don't know the difference with the mobile version. I'm upset that I don't feel rewarded as much as I waited, but on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], so I'll continue to play happily. I sincerely hope one day <Black Moor 2> or the old game <Maximus 1> etc. will be released on Steam! Thank you for reading the long article!"
1811990,1,136588671,"Its cute and charming, but it does have much difficulty to it. I think if it was better balanced out like say giving the varied leader options with more hp and with more healing items it would be better. But I still love everything else about the game and want to see it thrive in time."
1811990,0,136588272,There is a positive in this game - it made me reinstall slay the spire.It's not a roguelite deck builder - it's a randomized auto battler with screwed up balance.
1811990,1,136588263,"Really fun even though i suck at it, music is very good too"
1811990,1,136588650,"Lots of charm, and it's pretty tough as well!"
1811990,1,136587691,Amazing looking and fun to play game!
1811990,0,136588603,Weird difficulty spike
1811990,1,136587620,"I am absolutely in love with Wildfrost! As a fan of both rogue-like games and deck builders, this game hits all the right notes for me. The unique blend of strategic deck building and tactical combat makes for an incredibly engaging and immersive experience.The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the attention to detail in the game world is stunning. I love exploring and discovering all the hidden secrets that Wildfrost has to offer.But what really sets Wildfrost apart for me is the way it manages to strike a perfect balance between challenge and reward. Every victory feels hard-earned, but also incredibly satisfying. And even when I lose, I feel like I've learned something valuable that I can use to improve my strategy next time.Overall, I can't recommend Wildfrost enough. It's an absolute must-play for fans of rogue-like games and deck builders."
1811990,1,136587645,It`s fun. Looks really nice as well. I am liking it so far.
1811990,1,136587653,This game has cute goats. I love it.
307950,0,136588341,"Can't understand any positive reviews of this, the only fair comparison they seem to make is with a 20 year old FPS which if this had came out then yeah it'd been great but for 2023 it feels like a mobile game. There are no redeeming qualities for this other than it's free.. the gun play and movement have zero weight, the graphics, sounds, and animations seem store bought it's just.. it's all mid."
307950,1,136588798,good 3rd person game
307950,1,136588123,"Surprisingly not bad for a F2P game.The gunplay is a bit weak, but I haven't seen any outright P2W yet which is commendable. It really reminds me of that old Tom Clancy online TPS, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online, I am not sure if it's as good as that one but I don't think that one had PvE.Oh and did I mention PvE? Yeah, you can play short missions against bots, they are not as good as Insurgency, but again, not bad for a free game.As far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.Higher level characters seem to be a bit better, but I haven't played enough to know how good/bad the balance is. So for now I'd say give it a go, I've seen worse multiplayer offerings than this, though I am not sure how long will the gunplay hold your interest."
307950,1,136588083,"It's an OK game.Pros:fun enough game playplenty of ways to playeasy to run in 240 fps, good enough graphicsCons:there are queues to get into matches, which could easily kill the game, I assume there are not enough serversannoying grind and monetization of grindthere is no balance in the co-op missions whatsoever, some are extremely easy while others are extremely hard"
307950,1,136588232,"Game is so damn good, man... Game just came out and I ran 10 hours straight before taking a break. I haven't done that in ages. This is such a breath of fresh air and I'm definitely going to be supporting the devs buy spending a little cash on it. It's quality stuff and for a 35 year old gamer to be gripped this tightly says quite a bit. Kudos to the Devs! See you guys in game!"
307950,1,136588091,"Basically Warface + Rainbow Six Siege and then we got Caliber, I'm not a fan of Tps but somehow I do enjoy this game"

1527950,1,136587976,"This is a pre-1.0 release reviewSo I picked this game up towards the very end of it's EA cycle and I have to say I was impressed, If you're a fan of the Expeditions games, or Battle Brothers or any of those kinds of games, this is for you. It's a very competent turn based strategy and managing your party is simple, but still provides a good challenge when it comes to weighing up who gets healed, who's armour are you going to fix, will you devote some of your precious resources to crafting certain items etc. I had a lot of fun, I put just short of 30 hours in pre-1.0 and I'm sure I'll put in a lot more now it's fully released"
1527950,1,136587902,"Game is good, and fun.It doesn't have a central \"plot\" or goal aside from \"Get strong and rich\" and is very open ended, but also can get quite repetitive (I absolutely do not recommend Region-Locked mode as fights can get as long as 40 minutes with how many units there can get).It doesn't have the strategic depth of something like Mount & Blade Warband or mechanical depth of Battle Brothers, but it's a decent in-between."
1527950,1,136587893,This game is something really fresh. I like the approach to strategy and atmosphere. A lot of positive moments and fresh decisions. I recommend at least to try this game.
1527950,0,136587796,"Hot garbage.Better looking but still a shallow, downgraded version of Battle Brothers.Its so boring that its not even fun with friends.Avoid at all cost."

1772830,1,136616522,"It's the game you wish Umihara Kawase was.  If you like physics-based platforming, speedtech, bungee grappling hooks, or traditional fae folktales, this game will be right up your alley.  I had high hopes for this game, having kept an eye on its development over the years, and it has exceeded all of them."
1811990,1,136617382,The game is absolutely amazing i can barely stop playing it. Sure the game is difficult but that just makes it more fun.
1811990,1,136617399,Giving me the vibes of when I first started playing StS and Monster train. Like that good
1811990,1,136616548,"Bought this first day it came out, literally played it for 5 hours. As a roguelike addict this one stands out. People are saying it's imbalanced but honestly after 10+ runs I'm not sure I agree. It's hard yes but also rewarding, which isn't common enough in this genre imo."
1811990,1,136617243,This game is great its a fun new-ish take on the card based rouge lite! would recommend!
1811990,0,136616580,Balancing is an issue. Unless the intent was a Souls-like Deckbuilder.
1811990,1,136616411,"I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Across the Obelisk or other roguelike deckbuilders. I would place this game on the same level as those games easily, and especially if they address some of the issues I mention below. The game overall is extremely polished. The combat is unique to the genre with dynamic positioning options, card selections and manipulation, and tons of emergent gameplay with the mechanics interactions. Lots of decision-making and thought involved in your play patterns. Really creative ways to pilot your units and give them synergy.I will echo what other reviewers mentioned though, which is that the runthroughs can feel really feast or famine. There are some issues:- Enemies that force 'Aimless' onto your allies or have Aimless themselves feel very unfair, forcing your units to attack into thorns or other detrimental effects or to possibly get sniped by enemies. I think like 50% of my runs ended to Aimless RNG.- No option to decline card additions or hero additions.- Starting heroes can be very very bad with not many ways to salvage them.- No ways to mitigate bad RNG--not enough removal options. Maybe put discovered charms in the shop at a higher cost (Slay the Spire does this with relics and its a nice touch). There are a lot of charms that feel completely useless.- Limited path branching means not as much agency with map nodes--would like to see that expanded to have more choices.I really hope they plan on making balance changes. The game is easily worth $20 regardless, though!"
1811990,1,136616532,"Summary of the negative reviews: \"Waah the hard card game is too difficult >:(\". To address the negative reviews seriously. They mostly complain about game balance, but the game offers a lot of powerful mechanics to the player, and challenges presented feel very reasonable, usually only requiring a shift in strategy to address. Think Slay the Spire, that game is brutally difficult and is beloved for it, this game is in the exact same vein. Yes it's hard, but it offers so many ways for the player to succeed. Clear example is the companion Yuki, you can easily buff him to have more than 30 attack (heck much more in my experience) simply by spamming frost, this is enough to kill most bosses in one hit. He's too squishy for a particular boss? Give him shields. Low on health? Recall him, the attack buff stays for the whole combat. Anyways my actual review is below.My experience playing this has been absolutely great. First of all I love to see a fully complete game being released, it's surprisingly uncommon these days. Past that the game oozes charm and is extremely fun to boot. I'll lay out some pros and cons, but generally if you like card roguelikes and the art you'll love this one.Pros- Absolutely charming art- Fun characters- Unique and interesting card roguelike format- Card effects feel varied and uniqueCons- Random leader selection is a fun idea but leaders often feel less powerful and unique as the companion cards"
1811990,0,136616472,"I really wanted to give this game a positive review, but in it's current state the balancing is absolutely abysmal. For positives the the visuals/music are amazing, and I love the character designs. Everything is just so bright and color, definitely stands out compared to the likes of Monster Train and Slay the Spire. Though in a game like this I feel gameplay is the most important part, and this game stumbles rather hard on that front. You either get an amazing combo within the first 1-2 areas or you die. It ramps up far to quickly most of the time, to the point where most strategies don't work because you can't wait to get the cards you need. Either the card works now or you die, with rarely any inbetween. Hell you can get an amazing combo and still die thanks to the enemies just hard countering your strategy. Have fun with that barrage build when the enemies have nothing but teeth. There are plenty of interesting ideas don't get me wrong, but there really needs to be some work with this. I'm sure they'll patch the game to make it better, so I recommend holding off until so."
1811990,1,136616456,Wildfrost isn't unfair. The deck building is tuff. Having a bad deck make's encounters feel impossible and unfair. After playing for a while you get foresight for the synergies of cards (there are tons of them with the charm system). The deck building is very fun. The battles are very fun. 9/10 get a bigger brain.
307950,1,136617400,"Great so far!  Micro transactions, sure, but this does not seem to be a \"buy to win\" so far.  Gives you a decent amount of operators to unlock right away, but seems like it will get pretty grindy after the first few.  I am 11 levels in on my account so far and this is super addicting."

Hopefully the game will still have players long enough for them to iron out the issues.
307950,1,136616333,better than cod. but thats not saying much. think the hero shooter style of siege but the game play of the old ghost recon online game released over a decade ago. neat indie shooter.

1949030,0,136618650,"Finished both, the original game as well as this version. Have to say the only improvement is the graphics, all other changes are just fillers and unnecessary, if not to say, laughable horror scenes. The remake is much easier. I did not expect, that the same riddles would have been implimanted, but the whole \"New Orleans\"-part, took me an hour at most. When I played the 2008 version I have spent at least an hour at the safe alone.Now the thing that realy drives me mad about this game. When we arrive at the hospital, I was quite surprised to see Dr. Gygax had become a woman, I am sure there were a lot of female administration staff in hospitals back in the days. And that all the staff memebers had decided to wear very obvious red amlets.May I remember that this part of the game takes place in Switzerland? And then,  there is not even a German synchro for this game.And then there are these stupidly made emotion scenes.  The developers take your picture of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and throw it straight into the rubbish bin.Last Frogwares game I have bought, did not buy any of the new games already. But I did not expect them to fail the remake like this as well.2/10 but only because the game looks nice"
1949030,1,136618797,"If you've played the old Awakened game, I would still recommend you try this out. Not only does the remaster really pump up the ambiance with the new graphics and improve gameplay coming from the Sherlock Chapter One mechanics, the story, while overall still the same, is still different enough to make it seem brand new."
1772830,1,136617900,Space buy this game its rly good
1811990,1,136619509,It's nearly the same as Slay the Spire and Monster Train but with different art. Balancing might be a problem though. Sometimes I get a hero so broken I don't even need to think or synergize at all to win. Other times no matter how much you plan everything out you have already lost the run because of bad RNG and you just didn't know it yet. Getting familiar with the gameplay didn't seem to mattered much. Felt like it was 80% luck to win.
1811990,1,136619463,this game is already so much fun and has insane potential.  I agree with others though that its quite unbalanced.  Still had loads of fun though
1811990,1,136619307,"I've got all of 100 minutes into the game and so far it feels pretty good, I think monster train is the most apt comparison I  can make for it, and whereas people say the RNG is brutally punishing I'm either super lucky to have made it nearly to the end in 2-3 runs (or I didn't and I don't realize how long the game is...) overall I like how the game feels. But so far devs have done an excellent job on the game! It's a gorgeous game, and it's a good time, I want to see it do well because the Devs have clearly poured a lot of heart into this game, and it is truly excellent."
1811990,0,136619316,"As most people noted, absolutely great concept but it's ridiculously unbalanced... It's not so much fun knowing that regardless of your skill you are extremely likely to lose, even against regular fights... So for now I'd say this is barely a 5.5/10, but as soon as they properly balance the game it skyrockets into a 9/10"
1811990,1,136618999,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING GAME! Art is just Beautiful!I had the opportunity receive early access and have now have played over 30 hours!Only completing my first run after 15 hours but at no point did i feel disheartened and i enjoyed the challenge.Absolutely love the variety of factions and characters with enough different mechanics that each run feels different and constantly working towards achievable meta progression goals.Like most deckbuilders the mechanics at times can seem overwhelming but taking your time with turns definitely pays off.
1811990,1,136619069,"This game is amazing. it captures all the fun of exploring new strategies building decks and running up against new enemies that you have to figure out how to beat in an amazing style with it's great graphics, music, and sound design. lots of people seem to be unhappy with the balance of the game, saying there's too much RNG, but i disagree. if you build your deck in a good enough way (which takes some trial and error) then you'll be able to deal with anything the game will throw at you."
1811990,1,136619144,I've played a few runs of this game now and really starting to enjoy it!
1811990,1,136618772,"As someone who's constantly looking for new deckbuilders to try out, I was really excited to check out Wildfrost's demo earlier this year. The game combined an adorable artstyle with a high difficulty where it's uncertain whether or not you'll make it one third of the way into the run. The full game did not disappoint me at all -- compared to the demo, the runs have been expanded to include 2 more acts, and there many unlockables for future playthroughs.The game features wonderful artwork with a cartoony cel-shaded artstyle. All of the character cards have a personality to them, and I was surprised to see that some of the cards would change their appearance depending on actions you take in combat. Blood would splatter on their fronts, a monster would grow depending on how enraged it got and an ally would increase the size of the snowball in their hands after you power her up.Added to that are various interactive UI elements that react to your actions -- bell relics swing and produce noise when you hover your mouse over them, upgrades are presented as trinkets on a keychain that you can attacks to your units. The various locations you visit also have satisfying animations for interacting with them, be it breaking a slab of ice or feeding your cards to Muncher. This makes the game really fun from an aesthetic point of view, it's simply a joy to look around the interface.The combat itself seems to be an involved version of an autobatter: you play down unit cards, and they automatically attack targets (or use abilities) after their cooldown is complete. In addition to that, you can play skill cards to influence the battlefield yourself, applying status effects and doing direct damage to units. In between turns, you're free to move any and all of your units around the field, choosing who is going to be at the front to take damage, who can be sacrificed to the incoming heavy hit, and who should be sent back to your deck to recover some hitpoints. Other than these actions, each card you play takes exactly 1 turn to resolve, causing enemies to act immediately, even before your own units.This causes the game to be all about reacting to the puzzle presented in front of you on each of the turns. How do you take the least amount of damage? How can you kill the most enemies in a single turn, as doing so makes them drop more loot? Can you afford to leave this character out, or should you play it safe and heal it up, resetting its attack timer and having to play it out again later?The downside of this, is that the battlefield can get rather complex, with multiple enemies and allies triggering each other's abilities, some of which might be unclear to a new player or someone who's not in the mind to pay complete attention to the game. I have lost several runs simply because I forgot about a keyword an enemy had, causing them to hit my hero instead of the default target and losing me the game. The combat is unforgiving -- you're not given warnings or previews about the following turn, though you do get a battlelog where you can see what went wrong. One mishap that kills your hero, and you need to start over (or close the game to reset the combat if you don't mind cheating).Once you're dead, the game will show you the progress you've made towards unlocking new content. You can get different units to add to your starter deck, which are pets in this game; you can unlock new charms to find in your runs, which represent the game's upgrades; you can also unlock new locations to visit during a run and new factions to play, which feature their own decks and playstyles. I'm personally not a fan of meta-progression in games, though I think the way Wildfrost does it is fairly fun. At the same time I do feel that putting some of the encounters behind an unlock barrier feels a little unsatisfying to me. Additionally, the way the game's \"hub\" is organized is that you have ~8 different buildings. After you click on one of them, the NPC inside will show you what type of unlock you can get, and what you need to do to get it. This means that if you want to see all of the challenges you need to complete, you have to keep clicking back and forth between these locations -- and they're spread out all around the screen in a scrollable scene in buildings that aren't easy (for me) to identify the purpose of at a glance.I would love it if there was a list detailing all the quests in a single menu screen, like the one they have for achievements, and if there was a side panel using which you could switch between all of the buildings without having to scroll or look for the right one.The game's \"ascension\" mode where you increase the difficulty of the game after completing it is also quite interesting -- you both get penalties and boosts for doing so. The first two difficulty increases make it so enemies have a chance to be upgraded (while dropping more gold) and the waves come out one turn quicker (but your starting unit is played down for free on the first turn).Having enjoyed this game so much, it was a surprise to me just how many people found it unfun. I read the reviews stating that this is one of the worst deckbuilders around, that it has no sense of balance, that no matter how you build or upgrade your deck, you're bound to lose due to how much stronger the enemies are, that there is absolutely no variety in viable builds. Now, usually I wouldn't fanboy over a game I like just because it received harsh criticism, however, in this case it feels to me that the reviews like that are misleading.My opinion is that the game's balance is fine. I was capable of winning my run immediately after finishing the tutorial, but I lost because of a mistake. I won my first run on my 4th attempt, and my second one on an increased difficulty on my 10th attempt. The majority of my losses were down to me not fining a solid end-game strategy by the middle of act 2, or because I didn't pay enough attention and got my hero killed. Both of these are fine in this line of games -- you're not [b]meant[/b] to win every run. Some runs are you barely scraping by with a semblance of a deck you cobbled together, while others have you farm a ton of gold with an absurd build you were given. The deck variety felt good. It seems to me that you can win using a variety of strategies, [b]however[/b] the game will not let you win if you put all of your eggs in one basket. You're not going to win with a \"poison deck\" because that's likely to be weak against many smaller units, or with a \"thorns deck\" because that's weak against high-hitting enemies, or with a \"heal deck\" because you can't heal if you're dead to a 40 damage attack.The game will present challenges to you, and you need to be able to answer them appropriately -- you need to tank damage, to kill many small enemies quickly, to kill single large enemies, to put all your pieces on the board, etc. The way to do that is to know what challenges you'll be presented with, and what answers you can use against those challenges, both of which require knowing the game. Of course, sometimes you don't find the best answer, so you might have to settle for some mid option instead, but that's kind of the appeal of roguelikes to me. This mindset helped me get through all of my winning (or close-to-winning) runs, and it is what I feel many people who are dissatisfied with the game's balance are missing."
1811990,1,136618704,"Very fun and challenging. A lot of people are giving this game a negative review because it's \"unbalanced.\" which I don't think is true. Since its a roguelike there's some RNG involved but when you lose 99% of the times it's because you misplayed and not because you didn't get good cards."

2328760,1,136618566,"[url=https://linktr.ee/factorofgames] Factor of Games [/url] Steam Deck Preview Here: https://youtu.be/M_citpHNKnYLet's get straight to the point; Zen Studios has delivered another solid Pinball offering with excellent licensed tables and in-house creations. They have built a better Pinball FX3, and technically the latest installment is superior to its predecessors in almost every way. Additionally, they now include instant access to Cabinet Mode, which works well for owners of Virtual Pinball Cabinets. There are also updated physics to mention, and the exclusive tables for the new game look gorgeous! The biggest problem that most Pinball FX enthusiasts will face is that they own up to 80% of the tables and have paid only a fraction for each through the various Pinball FX3 sales over the last five years. There is no way to move these tables to the latest platform, which is just another barrier to enjoying Virtual Pinball. Don't get me wrong; it's not like Zen will pull Pinball FX3 from Steam and somehow remove the owner's access to the tables they already own on the previous version. They are just creating a distaste for PFX3 owners and potentially confusing prospective consumers for the new version of Pinball FX. It's bittersweet that such a solid offering can drag itself down by not giving the most loyal fans a path to bring tables forward and take advantage of the apparent benefits without repurchasing every table. The alternative option is to spend endless money purchasing monthly or annual access to the tables, which is nothing I am interested in. These access passes may be a good option for others, and I will encourage everyone to play these tables as they see fit. In the end, I'm going to hold off for the tables to go on sale and pick the ones that I don't own first and slowly ( and cheaply) pick up the remaining tables that I deem worthy of a second purchase.Enjoy!üéÆeeFoGeeüéÆ[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42825155/] Factor of Games Curator Page[/url]"
2328760,0,136618219,"Not impressed, \"Pro Physics\" feels like flippers are made of jelly (lack strength and accuracy), not realistic and not arcade-ish like FX3 either.And only for that change and some other minor visual improvement (that looks completely overdone and creates a lot of visual disturbance), they're charging people again if they want to play the tables they already bought in FX3 / FX2, using some ridiculous bundles to make it seems like \"it's a great deal\" for all those FX3 players.Optimization is not good either, performance is all over the place, loading times are quite high for a simple pinball game (even worse than FX3). Tables (both old and new) are overpriced, at least in my region. Table achievements are missing.And they also sell coins that you can use to purchase monthly and yearly subscriptions. Yeah, I'm gonna subscribe to a pinball service, sure. Good luck selling this one, ZEN Studios, I'm not gonna be part of it this time."

2109430,1,136621750,"TLDR:Game is very fun but quite short although it does have high replay-ability and a interesting cast of character but maybe a bit to highly pricedthis is my first game review but i wanted to make one for this game as i really hope it gets some love and i want to share how much i enjoyed this game and hope its a sign of more Tron games to come I'm a big fan of the Tron IP and it's such a shame that so little is done with it in terms of games. So when i heard they were making a VN detective game i was so excited as its a part of the universe we don't see much if at all and i think this really delivers that experience Set in a separate area from the movies lets this stand on its own, even though we got a short time with these characters we still learn alot about this world and how it has and is still evolving and changing, the talk of past wars, enemies and friends, new factions and ideologies. I want to talk more and spend more time here.The game is short and i can see people getting annoyed with the puzzle gameplay but i found it a nice change of pace.Overall a great time and i hope there is more to come"
2156300,1,136621386,I really enjoyed the change of pace in Unscripted as opposed to College Kings.  I enjoy CK but I do appreciate the more down to earth approach of Unscripted.  The only nitpick so far is the inability to scroll back.  I missed a few lines of dialog because of a double-click.

1811990,1,136621742,"im having an absolute blast with Wildfrost, each run i learn how to get better and unlock more cool and adorable stuff in the town. i keep telling myself just one more run but cant stop playing!"
1811990,0,136621393,"I have to echo many of the sentiments of those who have had issues with this game. I want to love Wildfrost, the graphics and presentation are just utterly amazing. The charm that this game imparts is something that keeps drawing me back to play another run, but the immense number of balance issues prevent me from trying this game any further. This is sad given that I absolutely love this genre, and would've loved another game to sink more time into, but in its current form, I cannot recommend it.Balance issues are as follows:1. Heroes are generally pretty bad: The heroes that you get to select at the beginning are, more often than not, underwhelming and completely eclipsed by the enemies you'll face, both in terms of health and damage output. This makes the early game significantly more difficult as I found that I was always leaning towards the tougher heroes and neglecting the ones with special abilities, simply to ensure that I had enough output to keep up with the games difficulty ramp.2. Most companions, charms and treasures are either bad, or just actively make your deck worse: Building a deck around some kind of strategy becomes either rare, or nearly impossible when the choices of companions you're presented with are basically unplayable, or don't meld well with your existing deck. The inability to 'skip' a pick, means you're forced to actively add cards to your deck that make an already bad deck, worse. The charms are all over the place, and the fact that you only get a single charm to pick from when you find them in the dispensers means that quite often you get less out of the route you take then you would otherwise need to keep up. Many of the charms are just straight up bad. I only once in all my runs managed to put some kind of coherent strategy together, and even then it wasn't enough to beat the run.3. Enemies swarm you: It didn't take long me to realise that this games balance has some serious issues, particularly when waves of enemies keep spawning at a rate far greater than your ability to dispose of them. Given that many enemies can act faster, have more health, and even hit harder than anyone on your team, it makes the swarming even worse. Most of my runs ended because I simply couldn't keep up with the sheer number of enemies that were appearing on the screen. When the mini-boss of each stage appears, if you haven't sufficiently dealt with prior enemies, it can make the game unplayable in terms of difficulty.I enjoy a challenging game, and don't mind taking the time to learn how to play these better in order to overcome the difficulty, but Wildfrost's balance makes any attempt to trying to do that seemingly pointless. Beating this game seems to come down more to RNG with card choices, and charms then it does with the actual skill of the player. Either you lucked out on an extremely good deck, or your run is just dead.For the above reasons (and many others that have been mentioned in other reviews), I cannot recommend Wildfrost."
1811990,1,136621515,"I've followed the game since its first anouncement on the Nintendo Direct a year ago. I've played demo for hours and hours and it's a blast to finally touch the real thing.The gameplay is quite original. I spent a lot of time on Slay the Spire, which is also a Deckbuilder/Roguelike, but it has a completely difference turn system which is very fresh. Each action has a great impact on the game, and you need to think wisely about if using that card is worth a turn, or not.Graphics and musics are just perfect. I'm a sucker for this art style.I see a lot of people posting negative reviews because of balancing problems. I can agree that some mechanics are clearly more powerful than others, but that's also the fun of it, discovering what works or not. I'd like to see corrections and new mechanics added in the future, but for the time being, I think it does the work well enough. My only real critic would be that we have too little control over the contruction of our deck. More ways to banish a card or reroll a treasure would certainly be a nice addition.It is quite a difficult game, that's for sure. I don't see it as a negative though, quite the opposite. Just take that into consideration if you're not a big fan of struggle. Personally I'm not a good player at all, I'm just a masochist, haha. 'Took me 10 hours to have my first victory, and let just say that a second one might take a lot more time !"
1811990,1,136621598,"Game feels amazing.  Fluid easy-to-grasp gameplay, great art and music, super super crisp UI, and it's properly challenging.  I'm sure the balancing is a little wonky, but this game was obviously designed to make you earn every fight.  I wouldn't pay too much attention to the players screeching because they haven't won a run yet, seeing this complaint a lot recently on more difficult roguelikes.  Dudes with 2 hours in a game expecting to be cruising through everything is laughable.  I personally get excited when a deckbuilder makes me sweat.  I also haven't won a run yet, but I'm excited to get home from work and give it another go.  Maybe the devs should consider adding an easy mode for the whiners?"
1811990,1,136621350,"Went into this blind and won my first run. I felt like I got some nice synergies going, but definitely made some mistakes along the way due to not knowing how all the different systems worked. I made a few big blunders during the last fight as well. If you are experienced with other roguelike deckbuilders, don't be dissuaded by the negative reviews claiming the game is too difficult."
1811990,1,136621216,"[h1] IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! [/h1]If you have any experience at Roguelike Deckbuilders you will enjoy the game just fine. People whining that the game is difficult and unbalanced just don't know how to adapt to the challenge thrown at them. For reference, I finished a run on my 2nd attempt without any meta progress unlocks. While i understand people are frustrated because they have a tough time making progress, this doesn't warrant a negative review, otherwise all Souls-like games would be downvoted to oblivion. Some enemy decks will counter what you are building and the fight may be tough, but not unwinnable. I disagree on so many exaggerated claims made by various reviews that i wonder why they are playing a game from this genre in the first place."
1811990,1,136620930,"Very entertaining card game that manages to stand out from the roguelike card game horde with good artstyle and a unique battling system that reminds you of duelyst. Deep enough for replayability, however the main flaw right now is GLARING balancing issues, (Heroes are nowhere near to average in power level, same with followers, impossible to build around, card pool has no rerolls). However, these are fixable problems, and easily fixable at that. The core of the game is solid and charming, so expect this one to stay. Solid 7/10 as of no0."
1811990,0,136621208,"the game is beautiful, and I bought it due to  streaming. But honestly it is very unbalanced as there are only boss fights in every level which means big jump in difficulty.And I have to spend time to unlock rather than enjoying the game. I know we both want players to enjoy the game longer. BUT why in this way?So at the moment, i will not suggest to play this game til a big update."
1811990,1,136620825,"The game is fun and engaging if you're a fan of planning ahead and strategizing. While there are many actions happening in every turn, all enemy actions are telegraphed multiple turns ahead and once you understand the order in which they are executed, you can plan accordingly.  All those negative reviews criticising the balancing aspect are imo by players who do not enjoy this planning and don't do it thoroughly enough as it is easy to overlook something (which may even get you killed). In 4 hours I played 4 runs, won 2 of them, and died once to the final boss and once midway through. Balancing seems fine. Or maybe I am just lucky :PIf I were to criticise something its that the different abilities / status effects are not explained ideally so some interactions are initially uncleaer. This fixes itself with some more experience though."
1811990,1,136620854,"My first review ever, but I feel compelled to leave one because I cannot understand all the negative reviews on this game. I love it. The look, sound, and feel are all perfect. It puts a new, highly addictive spin on the deckbuilder genre. It is hard and needs balance, but even in its current state, it‚Äôs flat out a blast to play and we‚Äôll worth $20. Most importantly, it plays flawlessly on Steam Deck with controller support, which is a rarity for deckbuikders."

Honestly, i am not very keen on in card games but the board game-like gameplay of this game sounds interesting to me. I played it 15 hours until now and i want to say that: The game is better than i expect. The first hours of the game may be difficult for you but after you realize some mechanichs of the game it will be more delightful.  There are so many combos you can do with using cards and upgrades, so many different ways to build your town. You will be discovering all of them while playing. Considering it's an early access original indie game, i strongly recommend you to buy this game. Finally, i want to thank all the great people behind the project. Good luck with your upcoming games!"

2354600,1,136620317,"So, I don't know if there are different endings or anything like that, but I have at least completed the \"Feed\" options on all 3 levels with Renfield, so I think I have some ability to say certain things. Game is awesome. The pixelated style is a common choice for these roguelite games, but the combination of the music, the animations, and the sometimes goofy moments makes me wonder what the movie will be like. Which...is probably what the developers want, but I have to say, they do it well. So whatever gripes I may have being advertised to by a videogame are all unimportant since it worked >:)Some visual/gameplay issues I noticed. Hitboxes are not very defined. I can sometimes get right into an enemy's face without getting hit, and the others it feels like I got suckerpunched from nowhere. And that is just the melee enemies. The enemy bullets are hard to keep track of. I had a buddy watch me from the side and with all the shimmying about I was doing to hit the enemies, I neglected the bullets that were apparently obvious. Now, that might be my ADHD at play, but I was definitely getting better about avoiding most of the onslaught of projectiles. Another issue is the controls. Not having a cursor from your mouse made things a little wonky in the menu screen. At first, the game crashed on exit, but it seems that was fixed pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to win...for some time. Or maybe I am just bad at the game (:Ideas for the future? I am not going to tell the developers how to play the game, but some things I had questions on are how hard it is to understand anything. For example, the Victims you are to save or kill...I think an achievement is related to this option, but I can't determine how to go about it. I both saved and killed the Cheerleader in the first level with Renfield, but there was no obvious difference in result, save for time remaining upon reaching the boss room and the amount of money that was rewarded. Is money going to be more important in a future update? Also, the shop was a little surprising. It took me a bit to realize there were other tabs lol. Also also, the coffin was something I wasn't sure what it did until I realized I had to buy it multiple times. I had thought its effect was an upgrade I got in a run.All-in-all, the game is hectic, visually stimulating, probably a good game to watch for streamers, and if this is just the beginning, then I am looking forward to what the developers bring in the future.I will keep playing just to see if beating the levels in both Feed and Save options for both playable characters will do something. Then I will play to see if there are good synergies.(Bats, bats, we are the bats)"
1527950,0,136621775,"Very buggy. Keeps opening in the wrong monitor, doesn't seem to recognize which monitor is monitor 1-3 but also upon loading or quitting shuffles everything on monitor 1 to monitors 2 or 3. No other game or program does this so it's obviously something to do with this game. On top of that it locks up and crashes often. Sometimes at the end of a battle you try to click continue and it'll sit there for 5-6 minutes before giving you the reward and allowing you to continue. Sometimes it just locks up entirely and you gotta reload before the battle and replay the whole thing. Hope you saved because the auto save overwrites itself. On top of all that it encrypts all the values to prevent people from cheating in a single player game. Annoying and dumb design decision. Let people cheat in single player games if they want. Wait a few weeks/months for the bugs to be fixed. Absolutely don't buy if you use a multi-monitor setup. It's an exercise in frustration using 3 monitors. Given how often it crashes it absolutely needs multiple autosaves and shouldn't just overwrite the exiting one into state where it crashes when you click continue at the end of a battle. Also at least one farm in the starting zone doesn't have an exit.... Hope you enjoy replaying the last autosaved battle."
1527950,0,136621651,"This might be a good single player game, but I bought this with my friend and I play most games co-op. This is not a very good co-op game because you can't do anything independently. If he clicks on a merchant, I get the box. If I close that box, it closes on his end. It's basically co-op in the sense that we might as well be a the same computer playing the same game. The art looks like those old point and click flash games. It might get better later, but there's a 2 hour return policy so I stopped playing just under that mark to get my money back."

But be warned - you may never see the Easter Bunny in the same way again."

No! it is very similar to these games, but there are many interesting mechanics of your own and the ability to create your own world as you want! isn't it cool!?Build houses, explore new locations, fight mobs, and if you're bored with all this, then do farming with goblimans :D"

1949030,1,136624589,"I am a massive fan of Sherlock Holmes, within the universe from Frogwares, and in the original works and adaptions of the character. It goes without saying that Frogwares developed an incredible game during a very difficult time, and they continue providing such a compelling and analytical portrayal of the character, through his mind and his emotions, it's a beautiful new perspective, and an amazing follow-up from Chapter One. Although it is evident that this game is shorter than CO, it provides the same joy and excitement, and the discussions about Sherlock's past was a wonderful touch. There are reduced puzzles, and more hand-holding in regards to deductions and observing, but the narrative makes up for it entirely, and I am slowly playing through it as I want to experience everything this game has to offer.Thank you Frogwares, for giving us such a beautiful remake!"

2109430,1,136622947,Fun short story in the Tron space. The setting lends itself well to interesting philosophical though. The game touches on some of that but mostly leave space for the player to think about it and as such I am sure this appeals more to the type of player who wants to replay and discover all of the possible dialogs/options.The minigame is simple but fairly easy to learn but never got super far into the digital design space - feels like a paper prototype that just worked well enough to be fun. As a whole the game shows restraint and never oversteps its bounds but as a Tron fan and a fan of the studio I would have been on board for something deeper if that is something they ever get the chance to go for.
2109430,1,136621759,"üü¶ Looks like Tron.üü¶ Smells like Tron.üü¶ Sounds like Tron.üü¶ Turn music volume down to 0. üü¶ Play or stream \"Tron Legacy\" soundtrack by Daft Punk whilst you play.

1811990,1,136624546,"Wildfrost is a magnificent card game that challenges the player in many ways. Featuring excellent art, a wonderful soundtrack and intuitive gameplay, I'd recommend it to people that are looking for a new challenge in the card battling genre. It can be difficult at times, and could do with some tweaking in that area, but the challenge is something I really enjoy in this genre."
1811990,0,136623970,The game is too unbalanced at this stage - almost two hours of gameplay and unable to progress to the next stage despite being familiar with other roguelite deckbuilders such as StS.
1811990,0,136623873,"[b]Note: I've won a couple of runs, I'm not just bad at this game.[/b]Maybe the most RNG deckbuilder I've ever played.  You will often run into a wall of enemies your team can't fight because you don't have the one specific card type that counters them.Example: Third fight in the run. I have been able to pick TWO additional cards from six options so far this run:Got a guy that gives teeth (damage when hit) to all his teammates but he's sat at the second row (behind someone else I have to kill first to hurt him). My range cards do two damage and has 14 health. I can't fight the enemies in front of him as they have teeth that hurt me, and I can't hurt him as I don't have a yank or long range damage card as none have been offered to me. I just lose.The art/sound is 11/10. Should have been early access to get balanced properly before 1.0."
1811990,1,136623282,"Having a blast playing this game! I really cannot understand most negative reviews.The game is difficult. But to say it has balance issues or bad design after playing it for not even a day is kinda irrational.Because of the higher difficulty, every run is challenging and I learn something new each time I play.And winning a run feels really great!"
1811990,0,136623144,"This game has a lot of good ideas and fantastic art and music, but it's fundamentally let down by extreme RNG.In most games, of this kind, such as Slay the Spire, you get like 30 choices of cards to add to the deck, events to get things that change your playstyle etc. over the course of a run. That gives you the ability to minimise the effect of RNG, so you can strategise and make the most of a bad situation if it comes to that.This game gives you about 9. This means the enemies ramp up quickly and so the only successful runs will be the ones where you get extremely lucky. There's no chance to mitigate bad RNG. You just don't get the opportunity. You have to hope every time you get a card or charm that it's the exact one you need. As a result, the \"rebuild and restrategise\" that's advertised, just isn't there. You roll the dice again and hope you get lucky."
1811990,1,136622843,The animation and character design is lovely. Reminds me a bit of Adventure Time. The game-play is pretty punishing. Things go bad very quickly and there is no retreat mechanic: even a minor misplay can cost you the run. But it's super addictive and satisfying to play.
1811990,1,136623193,"Very fun, but hard. Took 3 hours of playtime to get my first full clear. Will probably get a lot of playtime out of this game"

307950,1,136624553,the game itself is amazing. played it already two years before steam release on the origin webside.the game is fun and its tactic and make sense. it just fight its own problems where the devs are not fault of:1. nobody wants to play medic because people get toxic if you do just one mistake2. your random team mates are always complete egoists and most times die like flies3. nobody in random game use teamspeak and if you do as the only one they suddenly jump in just to teach you swearwords4. most time you play against veteran players while being bambi and they unlocked all the good stuff already that you do still dream about and if you cant stand on own feed and your team is worth a shizz than you are fishfood for the big onesits a good game. play it with friends and teamspeak only. its worth it.  i do recommend it because i once had a good time playing - i just have no friends who play and so i feel pretty lost in there. still a round here and there..why not.
307950,1,136624640,The game gives you the feel of a special combat force involved in war activities. The modes and guns are good.
307950,0,136623974,"(This Review is more in the middle than a simple yes or no)Just gonna say first of all this game is fun gameplay is actually really good but I decided to calculate how long it would take to collect all operators that are available for purchase through just the daily challenges as I have yet to unlock the weekly challenges or any of that so will update this accordingly when I get to that point. And as a addition this is without unlocking any operator upgrades or skills as the time would heavily differCredits from daily objectives:No Premium = 27,050Premium = 38,850To get all operators for a class is:100,000 x 3 = 300,000 credits150,000 x 5 = 750,000 credits200,000 x 6 = 1,200,000 creditsAll together = 2,250,000 credits(This isn't counting the 4 operators that could only be obtained through a previous battle pass)So to get all operators for a class as both a non premium and premium player (Remember this game has 4 different classes)Non Premium - 2,250,000/27,050 = Approx. 84 days of daily challengesPremium - 2,250,000/38,850 = Approx. 58 days of daily challengesIf you wanted to buy these with coins (the premium currency) operators in this game cost either 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 coins depending on credit cost of operator (shown above)Prices for coins:2,250 coins = $11.995,000 coins = $23.99I get it as a free to play developer you need to be making money but if you don't really give a decent incentive and give people the opportunity to unlock stuff in your game within a somewhat timely manner then this might knock a lot of people from wanting to play a gameLike I mentioned at the start the gameplay of this is really fun has a nice ghost recon feel to it and this game could really be something good but please look into what people get with their time"

2328760,1,136623241,"Expect a lot of reviews related to the pricing model, some justified.  If you can get past that, you have a really solid, state-of-the-art pinball game that's a meaningful upgrade from FX3.After 100+ hours in FX on Epic and 100+ hours in FX3 on a lot of the same tables, the new FX is my go-to platform and the one I see myself playing long into the future.  The difference is all in the physics.  There's some visual upgrades for sure - which are actually a mixed bag at the moment, because while the game looks great, it's wildly unoptimized - but what's important in pinball is how it /feels/, and FX feels fantastic.  To compare the two, FX3 is fun and springy, easy and arcadey, while FX, to me, feels like far more like playing real pinball.  It's more challenging and realistic, more unpredictable, faster and less forgiving.  The default competitive mode is \"Classic\", which allows you to play for scores and excludes the powerups that were a necessity in the default mode of FX3 if you wanted to top the leaderboards.  If you're still after the powerups, you can find them in \"Arcade\" mode, but \"Classic\" feels great in my hands, and if you want a challenge even above that, there's \"Pro\" mode on each of the Williams tables with a steeper playfield and tougher rules.  This game is imperfect, and a work in progress (please add proper Ultrawide support!), but it doesn't deserve to be drowned out in negative reviews.  I'll update this with some more detailed thoughts, but if you're any sort of a pinball fan at all, ignore the hubbub and give FX a look.  You'll be glad you did."
2328760,1,136622979,"Having played many hours on Epic, I'm so happy to see this launch on Steam. The biggest draw to Pinball FX is the updated physics system coming from the prior entry, Pinball FX3. While much of this may feel minor at first, the ball behaves far more consistently across different tables and the challenge on the non simulator pinball tables (i.e, Zen Originals and franchise crossovers) is much faster and weighty. Graphically, it is a solid improvement if you have a capable PC. The ray-tracing is nice, although not mandatory. It is much improved over its early access performance, and I now get around 90FPS with max graphics settings at 1440p with ray-tracing enabled. Hey, it's just nice to see those reflections on the glossy board :-) The elephant in the room is the lack of DLC carryover to the new platform. While unfortunate, I believe this is a passion project geared towards enthusiasts. Recreating each table takes time, so does implementing ray-tracing, updating lighting, and ensuring all of the prior systems work with how the ball and flippers now behave; this is no small feat. Given the DLC packs which discount purchases of updated tables if you already own them on PFX3 (See the legacy bundles), I think it is fair. Zen have provided multiple ways to discount tables and assist long-term players in the transition to the new system. No, you don't *need* to update to Pinball FX if you are happy with Pinball FX3. Keep your purchases there and keep enjoying the game! Those tables are still great. However if you are an enthusiast, you will enjoy playing these tables with their updated physics along with the already hefty amount of new content. I have particularly enjoyed Wrath of the Elder Gods, Grimm Tales, World War Z and the new William's tables (Addams Family, finally!). Two thumbs up from me. Zen have really pulled through after their rocky launch on Epic and I'm excited to see how this platform develops for years to come. Between the Punishinly accurate Williams simulations, the video-gamey Zen Originals and numerous franchise crossovers, I believe Pinball FX has truly become THE hub for Pinball, no matter how you engage with the game."
1913870,0,136622949,Good waiting in the lobby simulator)
2077590,0,131242928,"Feels like a frustration simulator. Random attacks magically appear at increasing frequency through the waves, leading up to the final wave being an onslaught of BS moves that CC you, with the ability to default attack enemies or use the healing move being tied to standing still - which is impossible at this point. Even though the point is obviously to survive the 20 waves, it still feels more of a pointless endeavor than other games within this genre. It may be because the enemies are all autopathing looking like they are in a MOBA going to a tower, but they are just doing large loops around the map I think, with no destination. There are good bits that, if changed quite a bit, may be fun in the future. But I think the majority of positive reviews currently posted are probably less than genuine. I would have returned it even for the $3, but I took my dog out for a walk and didn't see I left it on for 2.5 hours."
2077590,1,133726454,"this game is infurating. Keep getting wombo comboed by the world itself. Reminds me of when I'd play LoL and get destroyed. I think the difficulty should be toned down a bit. Also different characters should have different attacks, there's not much attack variety. but it's fun nonetheless, and it's a not overpriced unlike a lot of games."
2077590,1,134333464,still early access but i've definitely gotten my $3 worth. that extra layer of dodging skillshots and traps adds refreshing depth that is truly unique among survivors games up till now. definitely had some of my most chaotic moments out of any survivors clones playing this game!
2077590,0,130907751,"I had high hopes for Sidestep Legends and I really wanted to like it because the concept is neat, but I feel like I keep going back to it and it just doesn't quite click for me. The player is offered a traditional bullet heaven control scheme, with WASD or gamepad stick usage and fixed camera, or one closer to MOBAs with the mouse doing all the heavy lifting. It's all about sidesteps, avoiding enemy attacks, traps and more, with a handful of enemy types roaming on predetermined paths as the mobs in a MOBA unless the player bothers them. Unlike the waves of Vampire Survivors clones, Sidestep Legends barely features any attack that can be used to damage opponents while moving, so players will be required to keep switching between moving and standing still, to dodge and to attack respectively. This is a fun take on the genre for sure, as it adds an extra layer of strategy and decision-making, on top of a higher skill ceiling.The issue is that it doesn't really feel too rewarding. The enemies are not very varied, and they pose a challenge pretty much only because the player has to stop to fight them, with an initial attack range pre-upgrades that is quite laughable. The base attacks and speeds are also superlow, though upgrades make them a lot more satisfying eventually. The map has XP gems and coins spawn all across, with even treasure chests and challenges filling in the blanks, but often these happen far away from enemies who, remember, follow predetermined paths. The game actively pushes you away from the action a lot of the time, with traps like gas waves, fire areas and hooks pulling the player back for extra challenge. This is the game's incentive to have the player moving... but again, you are supposed to stop to attack, which means that most of the time you will not be attacking, as it doesn't take long before you are looking at a couple dozen enemies and traps are spawning everywhere. Couple all this with fairly unimpressive 3D visuals and a skill tree that's packed with tons of expensive yet minor upgrades, and I just can't say that I truly enjoy or want to recommend this game yet. Even when the upgrades become more satisfying, some higher level skills and characters are unlocked and you're battling against a giant boss, at its core Sidestep Legends feels like you're fighting against the game's design trying to slow your every move and attack more so than the hundreds of identical minions you encounter in a run. A good bullet heaven and a good MOBA both make you feel swift and powerful, and unfortunately that feeling is too rare here for me to recommend the game as of now. I plan to revisit it in the future because it's still in Early Access and I believe the concept can achieve a lot more with some balancing and design tweaks.Bullet Heaven Fandom review #47.

2077590,1,130711953,I've followed this game on youtube for a while and it is developing very nicely. Quick to get into the action adn fun mechanics
2077590,1,130571366,"This is such a great twist (or should I say *sidestep*) to the arena survival genre formula. You have to strategize your in-run upgrades to create a balanced build that will allow you to have just the right amount of offense combined with defense and mobility to be able to survive the bullet hell. Lots of starting skills and they all combine and synergize with each other to create more unique skills. There's also meta-upgrades, characters and maps to unlock that makes for good replayability. The kind of game that really compels you to do \"just one more run\".Some gameplay here - https://youtu.be/f60rqswr7CQ"
2077590,1,130528878,"Addictive little game this is. Couple of fun different builds you can go for, my favourite so far is ADC.The game could need a score board, to make it easier to be competitive.

1364020,1,136629194,"I've only played this game for like half an hour and i can already say that i love it!There are some issues, small bugs and glitches like buttons not working and stuttering that occur sometimes, but the game was only released to early access a few hours ago so its not a big deal.First off i've got to address the sound design which is absolutely amazing, for example the sounds from outside of your helmet are muffled in a fantastic way. Gun sound powerful and the boosters make my ears moan.\"but space doesn't have any sound\" you're free to take off your headset at any time, you'll see how fun that'll be.The Graphics are really good too, not out of this world but not bad either.The Gameplay feels good: the TTK is quite quick but not too quick and the weapons feel great and powerful.The movement has a slight learning curve too it (not negative) since you can turn in all directions in anyway which can make you loose orientation, but you do get used to it.Overall i think this game has great potential. With just some polishing, frequent updates and a steady playercount i can see this game become quite popular amongst FPS and space enjoyers."

The play style is the same as Chapter 1 (C1), despite that, I repeatedly made the mistake of not pinning evidence before using sight.  I did the same thing in C1, so this is very much a ‚Äúme‚Äù problem and not an issue with the game!  There is a singular overarching main case - the story is relatively linear, with side quests throughout.  If you have a side quest in the chapter, complete it there and then ‚Äì once you leave an area you can‚Äôt go back later to finish off.  I‚Äôll be going back and replaying the first chapter for that reason ‚Äì it‚Äôs not like C1 where you have free reign to go back on yourself.  There was only one thing I found annoying at times ‚Äì Watson! He kept following me and then trapping me in a room and taking ages to step out the way.  I did have a glitch in the game where Watson was managing to row a boat while hovering in the air alongside it‚Ä¶silly Watson!  The voice acting is on point and the music and produced very atmospheric scenes.  The game is graphically stunning and leans heavily into Lovecraft, which separates it from C1 entirely.  In terms of game play time, it‚Äôs a touch shorter than I would have liked, much shorter than C1.  I‚Äôve seen some completing it in approx. 6 hours, but for me, I‚Äôve finished on 17 hours ‚Äì I like to spend time exploring and collecting all there is to collect, racing through isn‚Äôt enjoyable for me.  I cannot leave this review without mentioning the beautifully interwoven patriotic shades of yellow and blue.  Such delicately placed nods to solidarity brought a smile to my face, and the team are to be applauded for their resilience in the face of adversity ‚Äì slava Ukraini.  Overall rating 8/10"

1811990,0,136629200,"Everything about this game is well done, except the deckbuilding and the combat...; the two parts of the game that are the actual meat in this genre.Action economy is everything: one card = one turn. Each turn, every character on the field ticks down by 1 - and when they hit 0, they activate and do their thing. Additionally, enemies attack first, so even if your units have the same timer, they can very likely perish.This means three things:(1) Companions are better cards to than most of the effect cards, because they'll activate repeatedly AND be removed from your deck AND can tank hits for you/leader.(2) Crowns [80g item] are the best item in the shop, and the one you should make sure you can always buy. A Crown on a card means that it can be played at the start of the game for free - giving you an extra minion on the board, casting a spell for free, etc; it's a 100% draw+play at no cost (minus the one-time 80g cost).(3) The fact that your minions get weaker for the next combat after they die is ATROCIOUS. While I said companions are generally better cards to play - this is due to their stats:activation time ratio - something that is significantly weakened should they die in a fight; and makes them detrimental cards to play (since your 1 turn playing can = 6 enemy turns ticking down). If you play a minion with the same turn timer as the enemy - it's going to get hit first, and likely die - moreso if it's still injured from the prior battle.This isn't a puzzle game, it's a punishment game. Frankly, there's a lot of times where there's straight up nothing you can do to play around the enemy/board state - and on top of that, each battles designs/mechanics are extremely polarized - you either might be able to deal with it (if lucky opener+having the cards in your deck at all), or you simply cant [and there's no way to determine ahead of time what a fight might be].Honestly, this game tries to copy Quantum Protocol's gameplay, but without the designs/mechanics that actually let you get ahead on the board; despite 1 card = 1 turn for the field. If the combat is the part of the game you like most about this game, you'd do well to at least check that game out, as it's a deckbuiler-puzzle game as well (don't forget as long as it's been less than 2h playtime+2weeks owned, Steam will allow you to automatically refund a game)."
1811990,0,136628857,"Heavily unbalanced, the game ramps up WAY too fast to be fair, most of the time I die its from a sudden surge that I literally couldnt do anything about, the leaders are WAY too flimsy when them dying causes instant loss. The challenge isnt from skill, its almost purely luck based, if i try to go for any build it gets fucked by the very next draw, it doesnt allow you to build any specific deck and you dont get enough heroes to not have to worry about all your heroes being at 1 hp, most runs if I get to a boss I end up with like 4 playable characters that cant take many hits. Hell the characters MADE to take hits cant take hits as any healing is EXTREMELY rare or has an insanely high wind up, even the first battle is insanely unbalanced, expecting you to kill mountains of enemies that buff from you killing enemies or those enemies attacking, that its just completely illogical, this game needs SERIOUS fixes in its battle progression.I recommend starting with a battle thats not a million enemies constantly buffing eachother to the point that they all OHKO the card that instantly loses your game.I saw RT play this and it looked like a lot of fun, I love roguelike deck builders but this, this just feels like a mess of horrible balancing and crappy difficulty spikes.The first 2 runs wont be too bad, but after that regardless of who you pick the difficulty ramp will be too high.Ill keep my finger on the pulse of this game, watching for updates as I really want this game to be good, I want to enjoy this, but thats not something I can do with where its at now."
1811990,1,136628700,"Not super deep yet but I am loving it. It's tough, but it's just so satisfying to play and the UI/UX is so good that I don't mind at all."
1811990,1,136628536,"Fun game, but I'll have to agree about the balance problems written on most of the negative reviews. Still giving it a positive though, balance, variety and replayability is lacking but core gameplay, art and music is enough to tip the scale to positive. It's also still pretty addicting. Hoping patches can help with these problems."
307950,1,136629152,"Alright so ive made it to account lvl 12, i have 4 operators that you get to pick from a limited selection via the training tab in objectives. it would be best to diversify your collection rather than going all in on 1 class. But thats just my personal preference, You play what you want to play!Right now it seems like quite an okey game, Gunplay is nice. Not to fast and not to slow in terms of progression, So far there is plenty of incentives for players to jump in and earn. And with the steam event currently going on you can get 400 premium currency each day just by winning 5 games. and there is 6 days remaining. However with that out of the way i would like to bring up some concerning points about the gameFor starters:[b][u][i]The Bad[/i][/u][/b]- Premium skins for operators seem to cost just a bit to much. at $16 all you get for your legendary skin is a 25% bonus to XP.- Insane pricing for HQ Backgrounds. Thats right for $15 you can get a pretty little rare HQ background called mountain pass that all it serves to do is just make the background look cooler.- Operator investments gets more and more insane in terms of credit cost.- Not Everything is initially available to the player and must progress account levels in order to unlock AKA, Daily objectives @ lvl 3, New game modes at 8 & 10, Weeklies @ 12 etc etc- Premium currency conversion is a joke, 1000 coins converts to 22k credits. which is like 1-2 upgrades depending on the operators level- Limited & Restricted selection of customisation via normal progression. Meaning a camo / emotes or takedown animations you unlocked for said operator only works for said operators team AKA... KSK, Seals, Grom, CST etc etc. if you unlock a camo for KSK you cant use it for other operators youve unlocked in other teams so you need to re-unlock it which is absolutely stupid.- Onslaught game mode is honestly a joke and not even remotely difficult[b][u][i]The Good[/i][/u][/b]- Gunplay is well rounded- Can be a heavily focused team based game, played against teams that are greatly coordinated and preform their operators duties well- Amount of diverse and engaging game modes.- Somewhat evenly balanced maps, Mostly due to just being symmetrical.- Acceptable Initial Boost to new players progression, you will be earning alot of credits and coins if you played right now, But for those that join a bit to late you will still earn a great amount of credits- All operators available for credits & the store will cycle discounts for purchasing operators with credits.- Receiving duplicate rewards via RNG loot boxes will provide fragments that you are able to use on a limited selection of cosmetics for your account etc, Would be great if this was expanded upon to other cosmetic aspects.TL;DRThere is good aspects about the game but there is not particularly good that stands out for the game to shine. it lacks in alot of areas but provides a good enough gunplay and gameplay experience that you can play for an hour and be modestly satisfied. The only reason why i recommend it right now is simply because the steam event is to good of an event to pass up and unlike other games grinding such events becomes tedious but winning 5 games takes no time at all. just play against bots!5.5/10"
307950,0,136628141,"[b][h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1][/b]\"Mediocre\" is the perfect definition for Caliber: it brings nothing innovative and what it has to offer could definitely be done better. Don't let yourself be fooled by content creators, generating hype and inflating things is their job. [hr][/hr][b][h1][u]My conclusions:[/u][/h1][/b]I find this title to be a bit of a disappointment, years ago I dismissed it out of hand since Wargaming was involved and now that I have had the chance to try it I notice that, unfortunately, it is yet another missed opportunity that yes, it is playable but has that something that it lacks or could have been done better. I was hoping to find a little hidden gem, but this isn't it.The game is generic, poorly balanced and with pay to progress mechanics which are really borderline to pay to win. (in the end they are two sides of the same coin, needless to deny)After years of development I definitely expected a more advanced stage and a more defined product and less biased stuff: most of the operators are Russians, the name of the Discord is written in Cyrillic as well as most of the Discord channels, the English section is relegated to two measly channels and so on.I will update the review (for better or for worse) as soon as I have a more complete opinion.[b][u]PROS[/u][/b][list][*]The graphic is nice, unfortunately you cannot change the brightness from the settings so some scenery comes out far too bright for my taste but all in all it is enjoyable and the maps, at least as far as PvE is concerned, are enjoyable and varied. [*]Most of the animations are done well, I appreciated the fact that the developers decided to take a more tactical, slow-paced approach than most of the games coming out lately where you end up with monkeys jumping left and right. [/list][b][u]CONS[/u][/b][list][*]TTK is too high.Believe me, I'm the first to hate games where you die with very few shots and I would abolish all the weapons that bodyshot but in this case I found myself in serious trouble.Bots and players are bullet sponges, only headshots seem to do fair damage but hitreg and netcode doesn't work as it should, which is one of the many reasons I'm avoiding PvP.I also find it absurd that in first person the scope is off center on most weapons.[*]An excessive grinding (it's still a free to play title, if you want to get things in human times without having to nerd out you have to pay, there is little to do about it) combined with few things to do and a very high cost of the operators present in the game (both with game coins and real money) is the perfect matching to bore you after a few hours, even Caliber's Twitch drops are a grind...And in true Wargaming's style there is the possibility to convert real money into game currency in order to have almost everything immediately, in some ways it feels more like a mobile game.[/list][u]My components:[/u]RTX 3060TI 8GBI5-9600K 3.70Ghz16 GB RAM DDR4 3000mhz"
307950,1,136628815,"This game is fun, if not a little annoying from time to time.The Progression system sucks, The points you use to level up skills should not be connected with how you unlock ops. I know this is a fReE gAmE and whatnot, but the grind just seems beyond ridiculous if you want new ops/camos. Since I can‚Äôt play Future Soldier or Phantoms again this is a good substitute. And for a free2play it‚Äôs not that bad."

307950,1,136626733,"Drippy operator designs, with over 70 operators to choose from, each one with unique skillset, weapons, gear, outfits, and belonging to many European and global factions, best part, 90% of them are obtainable by means of free gameplay. As of their current Steam release, the newbie welfare tasks and rewards are pretty decent, though how free currency will be gained further down the line is still up to speculation. Gameplay wise, animations might seem a bit stiff, but overall still quite immersive. The russian voiceovers are also a bit more emotive than the english ones. Decent replay value, though one problem is when I have to go AFK due to external circumstances, the game will impose an increasing increment of a time limit that restricts you from playing that game mode each time you go AFK; hopefully they'll address that because some players aren't trying to ghost teammates but are simply forced to leave due to real-life obligations, though of course I understand solutions to such issues are easier said than done.Game modes are pretty interesting, consisting of a variety falling under the main categories of PvE, PvP, and a combination of both, which is PvPvE. There's mini storylines and cutscenes for each mission to introduce the setting. (As someone who is more of a TPS than an FPS enjoyer (even though I am fine with playing both), because I like being able to see my character in combat, and not just their hands and legs. Its a decent addition to TPS games out there (and its free too), given how FPS games have vastly saturated the market in comparison. I never really thought about the TPS corner peeking argument or whatever because when you play TPS as a whole you don't really care about that since its not that big of an edge, just a different form of gameplay.)"

Oh well. Fun game eitherway!"
1893370,1,136628278,"[h1]Probably the best way for the 90s Arena shooter to take form[/h1]I'm sure we've seen our fair share of games trying to bring back the classic arena shooter to modern PC gaming, from Quake Champions fading to obscurity to the entirety of the Unreal franchise being erased from Epic Games' portfolio. Rather than retread familiar ground, Daev Team decided to take a left turn and have a story-based singleplayer game carry these familiar mechanics and level design.[h1]Story[/h1]Since this is meant to be invocative of 90s arena shooters, Ghostware is a game-within-a-game story where you died in the real world and are brought back from the dead with little memory of who you were in life, forced to fight against other undead spirits in a deserted multiplayer FPS by The Wizard, a stereotypical fat nerd reminiscing about the glory days (in his point of view) of multiplayer FPS where you've probably fond memories of spawning in as a free kill and getting ganked before you could even reach a weapon spawn with nothing to defend yourself with beyond a wimpy pea shooter.As someone who has grown up with more than my fair share of ZDAEMON and Zandronum with a bit of UT2004 sprinkled on in my childhood, I was able to get into the setting of the game and while I do like how the lore tidbits are collected through URLs viewed through a totally-not-Netscape browser, it does get a little difficult and confusing to follow the game's backstory due to 90s web design being what it is.[h1]Gameplay[/h1]For the better portion of the game, Ghostware can best be described as a stripped-down UT99 with fewer weapons, along with the addition of activated abilities that you can unlock as the story progresses. I personally don't mind how those abilities are implemented, though later ones that you unlock are definitely overpowered to the point where it'll be difficult to justify using whatever the upcoming Episode 2 has in store when you can just heal yourself willy-nilly during the more story-focused levels. I can say with full confidence that this game's definitely not for everyone but players who grew up with the old-school deathmatch games will likely be a fan of what Ghostware has in store[h1]Other[/h1]Being a game invocative of 90s multiplayer FPS, I can't help but think that progressing through the story or collecting certain pieces of lore should unlock levels and player models to use in the Instant Action mode. So far, the only things you get for that are the abilities you use in the Story Mode. One other nitpick I have is relating to a late game spoiler but [spoiler]personally, I think there should be a drastic change in artstyle in 03_CTF3 due to that map taking place in the real world. Sure, I get that the low-fidelity visuals are part of the game-within-a-game setting, though I think there should be a lot more in the way of visual distinction between the game world and touching (in-game) grass[/spoiler]Overall, this is definitely not a game for most people but I think this is definitely something to keep your eyes open for if you've grown up with the likes of Unreal Tournament and/or Quake 3 Arena."
1893370,1,136629075,"The nostalgia really pulled me in, the dial up tone from my teen years and the old computer :) reminded me of unreal engine, doom 64 and a few other games.

2328760,1,136629183,"Amazing lighting with HDR and Raytracing and most tables just look better all around. The only legal place to play classic Williams recreations like Twilight Zone, Swords of Fury, etc. It's only gonna get better. Trust me, we have come a lonnnnnnng way from over a year ago when the game hit early access. We now have proper portrait mode and all new tables will only be available in the new platform and not FX3. Negative reviews are from haters who want free table upgrades when this is not a simple port job. Everything had to be built in a brand new engine (Unreal) and it took a lot of man-hours. Further, Zen announced that old tables would not be free upgrades literally two years ago and have never changed their stance on that. Zen actually communicated this very clearly many times, but I guess not everyone got the message. Devs have to eat, too.Yes, there are inconsistencies in that some Williams tables like Black Rose have a highly spammable center broadside shot (not present in FX3 where it is a lot harder to hit) and many Williams tables play easier than they did in FX3 (and I would argue easier than real life as well). There are exceptions though, Space Station is still hard as is Dr. Dude and Whitewater. We still need custom cameras and multiplayer Battle Royale mode added as promised and we need VR (due to come out this year) but we are well on our way folks. Ignore the haters and grab this game! And hey, you have three free-to-play tables including Fish Tales, so what have you got to lose? Free one day Pinball Pass as well so you can play everything and see what is worth it to you.

1649740,1,136628148,"Firstly, if you're a Steam Deck owner, who, like me, trawls Steam reviews and forums to see how a game runs, let me open by saying that Hunt the Night runs perfectly 'out of the box' and is a fantastic handheld experience! Hunt the Night is a brutal beast of a game. On appearance, it seems similar to fellow pixel-art horror titles like Vivette and Lamentum. I expected a story driven affair, with puzzles and light combat akin to a top-down Zelda. What I got was a tough-as-nails 2D action RPG like Bloodborne. From an indie perspective, the game I found 'Hunt the Night' most similar to was 'There is No Light'. Now, let me be frank: this is one difficult game. You will die, and die a lot. Patience is an absolute pre-requisite to progression. The bosses are challenging, initially frustrating, but not impossible. After several quick deaths to the second boss, an anthropomorphic bird creature, I had to take a break to rethink my approach. You will not get anywhere by button mashing in this game.Your character, Vesper, has a close combat move, a ranged attack, a dash and a special move. Early on, your magical moves make little difference but it becomes a key tool in your arsenal as the game progresses. Weapons come in a variety of forms, some are slow but powerful, others quick but inflict less damage. The dash move depletes your stamina bar, so you must use it sparingly. And this is where I made some early mistakes. My advice to anyone picking up this game would be to make every dash count. Watch enemy patterns, look for their tells, and listen to the sounds when they make different moves. Another fatal error was trying to get too many swipes of my weapon into one attack. With bosses, I initially went in 'all guns blazing' and attacked at any opportunity. Later, after several deaths, I chose my moments carefully. I decided against being greedy, attacking with a single swipe and moving away, and using my dash to avoid the most devastating attacks. Perseverance is key. These bosses will not go down easily, and, just as you have got on top of their moves and taken half of their energy, they unleash a second phase of new attacks. It's worth mentioning that the game is not all combat. There are plenty of puzzles, from simple button pressing and finding keys to open locked doors, to more story driven object placement, similar to 'Silent Hill'. I never found the puzzles a chore, or something which affected the pace of the game, In fact, they give you more reason to scour each dungeon or the outer world (as well as provide welcome relief from the intense bosses).Sadly, there is no map to keep a check on where you've visited, or where you have to go. I found myself getting lost on occasion, particularly after leaving the game and returning to it after playing other games. I had a similar problem with 'There is No Light', although the developers added a map of sorts to that game post launch. I've really enjoyed my time with 'Hunt the Night' so far, and feel I am now in sync with what the game expects of the player. This is not an easy game to play, and may be too much for some. But, if you have enjoyed From Software's 'Bloodborne',  this is the closest thing to a 2D 'de-make' I've played. The challenge is great but the rewards greater."

1778060,1,117822934,"It's free to play and very early access so I'm not giving it a thumbs down, but it is not super tolerable to play yet.PROS - It's D&D with the To Hit and Damage Rolls- It doesn't look half bad- Good visual cues on how far you can moveCONS- Still buggy... hitting End Turn doesn't work very often and ultimately I had to exit the game because I couldn't end my turn- Moves VERY SLOWLY; e.g., the dice rolling needs to be about 2x its current speed. As is, requires a lot of patience just to move two guys around and attack.- The music, even if it's a placeholder, is intolerable- The bit I played doesn't seem to have any narrative or dialogue, so not very Table Top IMO"

1778060,1,135331341,"[h1]Before I played Roll For Initiative, I had a small pp, no friends, no gf, depression, and no life. These things havent changed, but the game is pretty good[/h1]"
1778060,1,117532552,"So, I'm writing this while it's in an Alpha stage, I think? Pre-Alpha might be more accurate. In case it changes in the future, I got this game free because it is currently free. Also, It only says 5 minutes played because I was playing offline. Now, with all that said...This game has potential. I like the concept, and even the story is sort of nice, though it's only told through implication.You start in 'Town,' and it's inhabited by Scottish guards who greet you with 'ho's there?' and 'Let's get 'em!' and proceed to try and slash the protagonists, BowGuy and NotKnifeGuy (you throw it, and BowGuy kept getting it, I think because he'd kill whoever the knife got thrown at?). Fortunately, if you get lucky and don't roll 1.0 damage a bunch, they go down pretty quick. After getting through them, you enter a chapel, where a Scottish vaguely-green skeleton warrior greets you by slashing at you. And you lose, because he's got a lot of health.After that, you get put into the 'Dungeon.' Fortunately, they forgot to lock your cell, or even put a door on it, or even put you in a cell. You leave the NotCell and are accosted by Scottish werewolf guards who slash you. After beating them, you could go right or left, but going right is completely pointless, so I don't recommend it (I did and it didn't help).As our heroes fight through the Dungeon, I feel obligated to mention a few problems I noticed. First, the End Turn button is a little tricky, you have to click below the text for it to work; or press T, which worked more reliably. Another being, the Dungeon is very laggy. Very. Maybe it's just me, but my computer (which is admittedly not made for gaming) could handle the other one/two (I'll get there) levels fine. Furthermore, two of the guards didn't despawn, fall over, or even lose their healthbar when killed, which was very confusing at first. But worst of all, a lot of times, after clicking the square where you want to go, though your character does move there, the graphic doesn't more. That's bearable (if confusing at first) but it's worse: the game is half-oblivious to it, rolling the dice on the misplaced graphic and MOVING THE CAMERA TO IT, NO MATTER HOW FAR AWAY THE ACTION ACTUALLY IS, which can be a little inconvenient when FOLIAGE AND WALLS STOP YOU MOVING AND ATTACKING ON SQUARES YOU CAN'T SEE, WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE TO DRAG THE CAMERA BACK EVERY FIVE SECONDS.Included in all of this was this situation: I came up on an enemy from behind a wall, so it couldn't see us. I left the pretty hurt BowGuy behind so he wouldn't lose health on this random werewolf. I walk out from behind the wall, he sees me. I attack him. BowGuy stays behind the wall that was JUST HIDING US. And the werewolf WALKS PAST ME, BEHIND THE WALL, AND ATTACKS MY COMPANION, HURTING HIM EVEN MORE.*Calming breaths.*Anyhow, after getting through the dungeon, there's another Scottish green skeleton guy, but he's much easier to beat up, though the character/camera broke again and... well, you get the point.After beating him and getting the 'PLAYER FACTION WON' message, you go to the next, third, unlisted level.You spawn in and it's icy, and less laggy, and you know immediately that this level is going to be special. Why? Because in the chat box that error messages and Player_Movement4 type messages were popping up in, was the messages 'LIGHTING HAS BEEN CHANGED (909 objects)' and 'LIGHTING HAS BEEN CHANGED (2 objects)' were there in red and white, and below them in faded text read something like 'disable text to disable.' Forward slash didn't open the chatbox, by the way.There's only one enemy on this map, another skeleton guy (he turns out to be Scottish when you get close enough). You move close, and let loose a shot with the longbow that he doesn't react to. Move a little closer, and he reveals his heritage and moves forward to attack. Then, you discover that BowGuy has a Spear now. How useful! So here you stand, ready to fight. Skeleton Man comes in to attack, and you know 'cause you shot him that he's got a lot of health, so this will be a tough fight. But you can feel in your hearts that this fight will end a reign of terror, free the Town and Dungeon from his evil grasp, and even though one of you may die, you will live on a legends, true heroes, who ended the reign of the evil Green Skeleton.He walks in range, and then does nothing. This enemy, presumably, isn't programmed with attacking yet. Not just that, him not attacking freezes the turn. He literally pulls a Sans on you, never ending his turn so you can't attack. This is your cue to press Escape on the game and go back to the Main Menu.If you've gotten though all this, you can probably tell I didn't have a super great time with my hour in this game. So why am I recommending it? Because I believe that the game will get better. Maybe that's a vague hope, a foolish hope, and old man's dream of a good D&D style game. But it is my hope and dream none-the-less, so I cast this stone in favor of a chance, that one day, perhaps, this game will reach greater heights."
1778060,1,117418667,"Still very buggy, but a good start. Interestingly the game is called, \"roll for initiative\", but the one thing you don't do is roll for initiative. I was scoring hits about 80% of the time. And at one point my characters were not updating on the correct spots on the map."

2109430,1,136633057,I love the art and the puzzles!
2109430,1,136631398,"Great game that utilizes an underrated IP. Perfectly combines sound, visuals, and storytelling to create a brilliant aesthetic.Wish there were a few more options for the branching narrative to buff replayability, but still a very compelling story for my first run. Looking forward to seeing more Tron related media in the future!"
1694740,0,136632296,"I hate to have to give this a negative review, but the controls are not proper in my opinion. Instead of thrust, WASD allows you to \"dodge\". Oddly, you have to hold down shift in order to thrust. This was unwieldy, so I changed thrust to W and just let that evasion direction go. But without reverse thrust, it's still too difficult to properly maneuver. I'm far from bad at video games, but with this kind of control scheme, I found it fairly impossible to beat even the second stage boss.Maybe the controls are such that you're meant to use the dodge buttons exclusively in combat, but the game doesn't make this clear and I'm not sure if that would work better. And also, that's not really how \"dodge\" is supposed to be used.That being said, I do like the other aspects. I like how the mining probes work, and the mechanics to force you to leave a sector after a certain time. I like the upgrade system too.That being said, without a revamp of the control scheme, I can't recommend this game."
1811990,1,136633035,"Don't normally review games, but the reviews have kind of done this one dirty, so I'm dropping this in case the \"Mixed\" (at the time of writing) turns someone off.This game is good. I experienced a bit of the demo and I'm at nearly 6 hours of play - I beat my first run a couple hours ago, and I'm really impressed with how unique the game is. There's elements of Monster Train and Spire in this, with an especially interesting counter system that counts down to unit actions. There's a ton of room for depth, and what's here is challenging, fun, and (perhaps most importantly with so many roguelike deckbuilders out there) distinctive.Negative reviews are complaining about the difficulty, for the most part (lots of curious eyes turned toward the \"balancing\"). I have yet to explore the full depth of the game, but there's nothing about the mechanics that feel especially broken or unfair. There's a bit of a knowledge game to be played early on, where you'll have to familiarize yourself with the different kinds of enemies the game can throw at you, but this is nothing new if you've played deckbuilders. Having to think about how your deck fares against different enemy builds encourages planning and being critical of your deck's needs, and the combo-kill system adds incentive to be creative and thoughtful even in the early/easy fights.The art style might make some folks think this is supposed to be a cute and easy game (it is cute!). It's definitely not easy. Making the most of the game's many challenging situations is something I'm looking forward to in future playthroughs, and if anything changes I may visit this review with an update. Check the game out if this sounds interesting to you!"
1811990,0,136632630,"Looks great but that's where the good ends. The combat is wildly unbalanced. Typically your choices won't make any differences and you will quickly lose again and again. Its not a matter of difficulty, but RNG. I'm also getting tired of bad games designing around the refund window."
1811990,1,136632896,One of the better card games. Maybe tune down the difficulty a bit.
1811990,1,136632591,"Found this game through Retromation, and it's as fun as it looks"
1811990,0,136632091,"Wildforst seems like an exciting take on the card battling genre at first. However, there are a few issues that I have with the mechanics/descriptions that the game fails to inform you of correctly.Firstly, I was under the impression that aimless meant the enemy or ally could even hit someone that was on their team, this does not seam to be true and honestly I prefer it that way but the wording for the description of aimless makes it unclear.Secondly, and this is why I believe I need to rate the game poorly, mechanics such as soulbound skulls do not work as described. It and items similar to it specifically state that it targets a random ally. In my best run (thank the RNG gods) I used the item and it soulbound my leader which meant that I could not kill the enemy I needed to or I would die... The enemy I soulbound was the boss soooo that did not work out for me.My third major issue is in reference to me thanking the RNG gods because like many have previously stated the difficulty spike in this game is insane. I've played games like Slay the Spire, One Step From Eden, Ring of Pain, Darkest Dungeon, and Inscryption yet this somehow feels much greater in difficulty and what many people are calling out as only a few viable builds are correct.I desperately want the developers to fix these issues and I know the game was only recently released, but these are my issues and I hope the feedback pushes the ball forward in terms of Wildfrost being improved."
1811990,0,136631992,"In its current state, no.  It reminds me of a very bare bones Monster Train.  I would wait for this to be on sale for at least half off or for them to add more content, quality of life and balance updates.  ProsThe animations and city building aspect are great.  Randomized heroes are fun.   ConsThe not being able to pass on a card mechanic is tiresome. The balance is, as others have said, a little out of whack.It's very tedious and grindy after a few runs, and not in a fun way like Slay the Spire.The insane amount of passives the enemies have vs what you can actually get.There doesn't seem to be a wide variety of cards to chose from."
1811990,1,136632353,"The art looks cute, but the game play is quite challenge. The time on each run is much shorter than StS or Monster Train. But no \"restart battle\" option, so you have to think through all the moves in advance. If you like deck building then give it a try, not that pretty as the art for beginner level players."

1527950,1,136631322,"Wartales......By far one of the best strategy RPG/Tactical games in a long time and incredibly welcome for a change. The developers have put so much into this game, from the small engaging mini games, to the detail in each game system, whilst not too complex, providing that level of depth to keep you engaged as you go throughout your journey in the world.The world itself is relatively alive and you can be ambushed, attack other parties and so on, engage in conversation and events with persons and merchants and so on.The combat is easy enough to adapt to if it is  not your go to and provides a degree of entertainment beyond a simple turn based game. With inclusion of cinematic cutscenes every now and then and the gore and so on. Combat is satisfying and the shear volume of makeup and parties you can have from mercenaries and animals alike leaves you with plenty of choice.The game mechanics are sound, criminal systems, repercussions for your actions in the world and a reputation based system that forms over time in the form of paths and knowledge. Overall supported from early days of development and by far one of the best EA titles I have supported to date and they deserved every penny. Will definitely be supporting Shrio Games in the future and hope they have many successful projects to come!"
1527950,1,136630011,"I didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised. It' s basically Battle Brothers but I found it to be much more engaging. If you are looking for a SRPG with solid and tactical combat and an intersting world to explore, this game is for you."

Also I discovered the existence of the tiny tiny birds and I screamed. Everything is so so cute and fun and I just feel so happy while playing this game. The devs really created such a lovely game with such cute artwork!

The game's graphics are nice, but that's about it with this game, the atmosphere is really lacking something to make it scarier and more immersive. Its gameplay is not that fun either because you only have to go from room to room to find the key for the next room (I think I've used the camera or something other than the keys to open one door but the game does not tell you much so I don't know exactly what I did lol). There is only 1 enemy in this game and it seems that it does not follow you everywhere (just on the floor you spawn) and when it catches you, you take damage from him but he does not move at all while attacking you lol. This game really does need some work but it is really cheap and for just 1$ you can support an indie dev and his work."

It's a small developing team not a Triple A title, there are going to be bugs. If you want a near perfect game go buy a $70 title at GameStop not a $12 game on Steam.The bugs are minor, the development team is releasing patches and fixing them as they are found so that isn't the issue.The game is fun if you like games like Gold Miner or Out of Ore where you are performing mindless repetitive tasks like removing dirt and selling it to buy new equipment.The problem is the actual mining takes little to no effort so it is incredibly easy to buy everything the game has to offer in one play session leaving you virtually nothing to do after.I can only hope the dev team has much more in store for DLC to increase replay value. There in game store contained a train in the demo that is not there in the finished game so there's hope they have more in store."
1949030,1,136633163,"Hello, this is the Man of Chaos speaking!Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is now officially live past two days. As a fan of past Frogwares games, even tho I am getting into some older ones in recent times, I liked the games I have played.It was one of the main things I have decided to back the game on kickstarter one year ago, or how long it was already, the time passes by so quickly.Quick disclaimer: I have not played the original game, or the remaster of it. Wanted to finish this remake of a game and now I shall play older ones, since I wanted to play this one blind.So, how did the game go? It is not an open world, neither it is not that narrow as one would expect. Played the game with Premium edition which includes small sidecases, which I deemed interesting, even tho they are nothing that ground breaking, since it is not the main focus of the game. Also by completing those, you acquire costumes, which in one half of a game you can wear, on the other half you have clothes limited because of the plot reasons, on the other hand, when you get to those, you have a lot to choose from, for Sherlock and for Watson. I had fun and I believe you will have too.For the main story, we have seven episodes, each getting you somewhere else with like two minor exceptions, which I will not speak of, as it might compromise the story a little bit. Nonetheless, they are nice locations to go through and I enjoyed every single one. As it is more linear style of game than previous Chapter One, there are those sidequests and the main plot, yet at some places it feels like there is not much, in another time it feels like there is a lot things at a spot. When it comes to difficulty settings, I do not know how much of a difference there is, since I ran it on the hardest difficulty. Difficulty has its toggles and you can enable and disable things as much as you like. At some parts, I had to make a toggle two times because of a reconstuction of a crime that took place, and I had no idea what I have done wrong. On the hardest difficulty you will see that you have done something wrong, but if you lower the difficulty, you can see exactly which ones does not fit the narrative so you can move past the sequence, because mainly it gives information which you use into other informations to know what to do, or where to go next. At some places I have run into a difficulty of finding some things which were there, and was looking for them for some time before I actually stumbled upon them. The game does offer you a radar saying what you can interactive with, but it seems to highlight things in an area where you stand or what you can interact near the spot, hard to tell how it works. Just be aware that some things can be missed, although you will get to it eventually since it might be a part of the crime scene where you need all elements anyway. Connecting information to know where to go next or how to deal with an important situations? We have that as well, in another variant of mind palace! I had run into some things being a trial and error, because you never know, if you have already enough information for it to click or not, or when you know what you are looking for, it might take some other information to select than what you would think, even tho after making it the way the game wants, you kinda get it as well.Story wise? Do not come looking for Chapter One or Crimes & Punishments, since its little of both. Mainly, it is a continuation of Chapter One, which was a reboot of Sherlock Holmes. This is what follows Chapter One. I had a lot of fun, mainly since I knew nothing of the previous games that this is based upon. Game has some horror aspects, mainly to the name of Lovecrafts. Those scenes are not there that often when thinking over the game, but they aren't there nor redundant or something that would hinder the game. At a part of the game I felt disgusted, because I do not take some things that easily, even tho there is nothing really appaling. Story in a lenght is like 9-10 hours, last (my nearly 11th hour) I hunted few achievments that I missed. On the other hand, I have loved the game, even when some would consider it short. The game takes you in shoes of Sherlock Holmes and Watson really well and I am grateful for it. Also the game has a lot of refferences and I loved to see them, if you played other Sherlock games, you might find them as well ^^I regret nothing, liked the game from start to the end. The side cases, the places you went to visit, all the emotions, puzzles, all of it. You can go through the game as you like, since thanks to difficulty settings you can play at your own tempo, at your own terms. I do recommend this game, as much as all those games I have played by Frogwares so far! I am looking for another release by Frogwares, already feeling stoked what comes next. Approved by the Man of Chaos."

1772830,1,136633228,"Played a couple hours of the Steam NextFest demo which sold me on the game (and even carried my save game over! though I'll need to replay start for achieves probably).If you're on the fence I recommend just buying and playing it a bit, the bungee grapple will probably take a while for me to master, but within the 2 hour refund window you should be able to discern if it's the kind of thing you want to figure out or if it doesn't jive with you.Shame there's no longer a demo, not sure I would've got it otherwise, or at least as quickly. I know Ultrakill is something I immediately hopped on after playing the demo, where I might've waited a bit longer after it got more hyped up to get it, but I think if you like what you see with the Rusted Moss gameplay, you'll probably have fun if you can clear the difficulty floor of the bungee."

1811990,0,136635207,"So... Fuck this a hard one to write because while I do love so many many aspects of this game, and probably will keep playing it. I do get why it's getting a mixed score. Usually, I don't write reviews but for card games in particular I feel like I have enough experience to properly rate them somewhat.Do I think the game is a horrible mess? No. Do I think it's as good as the genre mainstays like Slay the Spire and Monster Train, also No but it can be. It has some AMAZING qualities, the art style of course, the faster-paced gameplay, and I really like the combat that puts so much emphasis on the countdown mechanics etc. However as many have stated the game is wildly unbalanced or at least unbalanced enough that it feels like it's impossible to have good runs.

However, if this game gets a balance update and maybe just a few updates I think this can be a gem!"
1811990,0,136635511,"first steam review for a disgusting dev team with NO RESPECT to player feedback.not a newbie, i've played at least 50+ roguelike/lite games since the binding of issac; dead cells, splunky, slay the spires, monster trains, u name it.i agree with most bad reviews: the difficulty curve of this game sxxks, just because of bad game balance design. and guess what? the dev announce that \"we've noticed a large amount of bad reviews from chinese-language players and .......... here's some tips for ya. blahblahblah.\"rediculous. unbelievable. with no respect to people who expect to play your game and wait for such a long time. at least you can say \"we will carefully re-consider the difficulty design, perhaps add an easy mode (take the current version as the normal mode) in the future.\"and no. fxxk u. feel so stupid to trust u and pay u."
1811990,1,136635431,"Unsure why people think this game is too hard.... I was a bit worried after reading some negative reviews, but I bit the bullet and bought it, and the game is fantastic. I'm unsure where people are having issues with winning, as the game feels perfectly challenging. You can't play this game by just hoping you're so powerful it's brain dead, there is more thought that gets put into each battle. Definitely give it try if you're on the fence."
1811990,1,136634405,"Good game with similar beats from Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Darkest Dungeon. 10/10 art and clear interface.I beat the final (final) boss and I can see why people are complaining about the game being difficult, but that's what makes good roguelike games. It would not be fun if you could just brainlessly steamroll everything. My advice to new players is if they are familiar with other deckbuilders, the key is to make your deck concise so when you redraw, you get the same set of tools. You will just need to know what can handle what scenarios. The difficulty really is just a learning curve like all roguelikes. Also a UX suggestion for the devs: add death previews when it's obvious. For example if an item is obviously going to kill an enemy, have an X show up or something. Conversely, when an ally is obviously going to die at the end of the turn at a position, make it highlight red or something. With the number of things happening in this game, sometimes players can miss the obvious (I certainly have o-o) and this will make the game possibly feel easier.Overall I look forward to trying new builds and would recommend this game to anyone who really wants a brain tickler."
1811990,1,136634077,"Since reviews for Wildfrost (at the time of release) are so polarized, i figured i'd share my own early impressions.I really enjoy the core gameplay, you and your enemy's cards being on two separate lanes leads to tough decision-making situations and the cards you find throughout your run can have neat interactions with one another thanks to interesting but simple to understand keywords and card effects.Wildfrost feels hard but rarely in a mean way, some runs do end prematurely but i feel like that's just the game punishing misplays (perhaps too harshly for some).I'm obviously not far enough into the game to comment on how balanced it actually is, so i'll just say that the difficulty hasn't really lead to any strong frustration for me so far.  If you've played card battlers like this before and don't mind being slapped around a bit when you first get into a game, i recommend Wildfrost ! If you're more of a casual enjoyer or the idea of doing ascensions in Slay the Spire repulses you, you should probably wait until some balance patches and maybe even difficulty options are introduced before you make the jump."

1811990,0,136633287,"This game is extremely difficult, but not due to good mechanics or an ounce of balancing. This game is purposefully made difficult by severely nerfing the player's chances, and RNG are a joke. The scaling is abhorrently unbalanced, where the player has very little control over how their deck is built or how to synergize anything, since all your loot and cards and companions are RNG without any option to re-roll or decline a card option. Overall, while it is cute and has some fresh concept, it is poorly implemented where the only way they could make the game challenging is to make the player weak."

Get one day of pinball Pass for free and play 70% of the tables right now.I DID NOT play the 3DS zen pinball game but wen I was a kid I played a little game called \"Big Race USA\" which took my understanding and love for pinball to the next level.I want to talk about the history I have with the Pinball FX  franchise.  There's a ton of love but also some painful things.XBOX LIVE ARCADE.  Xbox 360 i was introduced to Pinball FX.  Okay, it ran at a terrible 60FPS but it was almost the definitive version.  It had local SPLIT SCREEN.  it had 4-player Online Multiplayer with our avatars in the 4 corners.  I owned all of the tables.Welp, i NEVER owned an Xbox One and never played Pinball FX2 on an XBONE so that means I LOSE ALL MY TABLES.But that's okay because Pinball FX2 VR comes out and now I can put my face INSIDE of the table.They added a few DLCs.  Def not enough.  (Balls of Steel in VR would've been appreciated.  idk.)Now I've been buying tables on Steam anytime there's a sale.  I own a decent amount.It's like rebuilding my old library.  And Now it seems like I don't own any again.Apparently I own \"Heavy Hitters\" on Pinball FX3.  A $10 pack of tables.  (probably got it on sale.)But it says I can complete the pack for $5 (50% off).  So if you buy Pinball FX tables you get the Pinball FX3 table with it.Who's going back to Pinball FX3?  I guess Me cuz why do we pay $5 for raytracing?

1649740,1,136634346,"Absolutely rock solid. A top down action game with strong combat, something akin to Bloodborne, though with shooting almost like a twin stick shooter, albeit a bit more deliberate. It's fast, precise, pretty tough, but fair. You have to juggle multiple types of attacks which flow together nicely, making encounters almost puzzle-like as you figure out the best strategy and maximize the use of your resources. The aesthetic is quite strong as well, with stellar art direction. I confess that I'm finding the narrative a bit abstruse at the moment, but that might clear up with time. The important part is that it has enough intrigue to pull me along, and a powerful core combat element that makes it worth exploring. A definite recommend!"

1968710,1,136637047,"MEATGRINDER is a perfect showcase of what happens when a small team has a singular driving vision and don't get bogged down by adding in every idea they can think of. The core gameplay is all about jumping on moving vehicles and feeling like a badass and every design element in the game is there to make you feel just like that. The weapons are super chunky and satisfying, the challenge is adequate and even though the game isn't that long, the game is pretty replayable because of the short setpiece levels and the infinite mode. I got a review copy for free, but that doesn't impact my review in any way, I genuinely like the game. Here's a full review going in-depth on the mechanics, length and a few issues I've found if someone's interested - it's more fun than reading a 5000 word steam review :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA4WnrHrpkc"

1118110,1,136635389,"I'm sure most of the negative reviews you're going to read are based on bugs. Yes this game has bugs. It's a small developing team not a Triple A title, there are going to be bugs.  If you want a near perfect game go buy a $70 title at GameStop not a $12 game on Steam. The bugs are minor, the development team is releasing patches and fixing them as they are found so that isn't the issue.  The game is fun if you like games like Gold Miner or Out of Ore where you are performing mindless repetitive tasks like removing dirt and selling it to buy new equipment. The problem is the actual mining takes little to no effort so it is incredibly easy to buy everything the game has to offer in one play session leaving you virtually nothing to do after.  I can only hope the dev team has much more in store for DLC to increase replay value. There in game store contained a train in the demo that is not there in the finished game so there's hope they have more in store."
1949030,1,136633163,"Hello, this is the Man of Chaos speaking!Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened is now officially live past two days. As a fan of past Frogwares games, even tho I am getting into some older ones in recent times, I liked the games I have played.It was one of the main things I have decided to back the game on kickstarter one year ago, or how long it was already, the time passes by so quickly.Quick disclaimer: I have not played the original game, or the remaster of it. Wanted to finish this remake of a game and now I shall play older ones, since I wanted to play this one blind.So, how did the game go? It is not an open world, neither it is not that narrow as one would expect. Played the game with Premium edition which includes small sidecases, which I deemed interesting, even tho they are nothing that ground breaking, since it is not the main focus of the game. Also by completing those, you acquire costumes, which in one half of a game you can wear, on the other half you have clothes limited because of the plot reasons, on the other hand, when you get to those, you have a lot to choose from, for Sherlock and for Watson. I had fun and I believe you will have too.For the main story, we have seven episodes, each getting you somewhere else with like two minor exceptions, which I will not speak of, as it might compromise the story a little bit. Nonetheless, they are nice locations to go through and I enjoyed every single one. As it is more linear style of game than previous Chapter One, there are those sidequests and the main plot, yet at some places it feels like there is not much, in another time it feels like there is a lot things at a spot. When it comes to difficulty settings, I do not know how much of a difference there is, since I ran it on the hardest difficulty. Difficulty has its toggles and you can enable and disable things as much as you like. At some parts, I had to make a toggle two times because of a reconstuction of a crime that took place, and I had no idea what I have done wrong. On the hardest difficulty you will see that you have done something wrong, but if you lower the difficulty, you can see exactly which ones does not fit the narrative so you can move past the sequence, because mainly it gives information which you use into other informations to know what to do, or where to go next. At some places I have run into a difficulty of finding some things which were there, and was looking for them for some time before I actually stumbled upon them. The game does offer you a radar saying what you can interactive with, but it seems to highlight things in an area where you stand or what you can interact near the spot, hard to tell how it works. Just be aware that some things can be missed, although you will get to it eventually since it might be a part of the crime scene where you need all elements anyway. Connecting information to know where to go next or how to deal with an important situations? We have that as well, in another variant of mind palace! I had run into some things being a trial and error, because you never know, if you have already enough information for it to click or not, or when you know what you are looking for, it might take some other information to select than what you would think, even tho after making it the way the game wants, you kinda get it as well.Story wise? Do not come looking for Chapter One or Crimes & Punishments, since its little of both. Mainly, it is a continuation of Chapter One, which was a reboot of Sherlock Holmes. This is what follows Chapter One. I had a lot of fun, mainly since I knew nothing of the previous games that this is based upon. Game has some horror aspects, mainly to the name of Lovecrafts. Those scenes are not there that often when thinking over the game, but they aren't there nor redundant or something that would hinder the game. At a part of the game I felt disgusted, because I do not take some things that easily, even tho there is nothing really appaling. Story in a lenght is like 9-10 hours, last (my nearly 11th hour) I hunted few achievments that I missed. On the other hand, I have loved the game, even when some would consider it short. The game takes you in shoes of Sherlock Holmes and Watson really well and I am grateful for it. Also the game has a lot of refferences and I loved to see them, if you played other Sherlock games, you might find them as well ^^I regret nothing, liked the game from start to the end. The side cases, the places you went to visit, all the emotions, puzzles, all of it. You can go through the game as you like, since thanks to difficulty settings you can play at your own tempo, at your own terms. I do recommend this game, as much as all those games I have played by Frogwares so far! I am looking for another release by Frogwares, already feeling stoked what comes next. Approved by the Man of Chaos."

1649740,1,136634346,"Absolutely rock solid. A top down action game with strong combat, something akin to Bloodborne, though with shooting almost like a twin stick shooter, albeit a bit more deliberate. It's fast, precise, pretty tough, but fair. You have to juggle multiple types of attacks which flow together nicely, making encounters almost puzzle-like as you figure out the best strategy and maximize the use of your resources. The aesthetic is quite strong as well, with stellar art direction. I confess that I'm finding the narrative a bit abstruse at the moment, but that might clear up with time. The important part is that it has enough intrigue to pull me along, and a powerful core combat element that makes it worth exploring. A definite recommend!"
1649740,1,136634962,"Hunt the Night is a very enjoyable experience that often left me feeling frustrated upon defeat but having that outweighed by my need to simply try again and be victorious. Aside from a warning that a little bit of time needs to be taken to gel with the combat and familiarize with the iframes, this is a very easy game to recommend to any fan of the plethora of influences it pulls from.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foacEBQsmhQ"

1968710,1,136637047,"MEATGRINDER is a perfect showcase of what happens when a small team has a singular driving vision and don't get bogged down by adding in every idea they can think of. The core gameplay is all about jumping on moving vehicles and feeling like a badass and every design element in the game is there to make you feel just like that. The weapons are super chunky and satisfying, the challenge is adequate and even though the game isn't that long, the game is pretty replayable because of the short setpiece levels and the infinite mode. I got a review copy for free, but that doesn't impact my review in any way, I genuinely like the game. Here's a full review going in-depth on the mechanics, length and a few issues I've found if someone's interested - it's more fun than reading a 5000 word steam review :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA4WnrHrpkc"
