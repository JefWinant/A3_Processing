2103530,1,136581288,"Let me get something out of the way: This game is in early access. It is running, it has some flaws and needs some features.  Now to the review: The game is good. It is a lot of fun. It is basically Melvor Idle with MMO aspects. You can trade with players, you have clans, you can chat ingame. This game is a lot of fun once you get into it and start understanding the full extend. (So after 5h when you need that long) YES there is a premium you can buy for 10$ once. There are other boosts you can buy, that are for X hours. But development and server costs should be accounted for by something I would say.  The Discord is very active, a lot of helpfull people are there. The Discord is the main communication tool for the game and I suggest it for every player.  Other from that? A fun game. It is basically Melvor Idle in MMO. If you like it because of that, is up to you."
2103530,1,136580398,"I understand people's complaints with this game but you have to keep in mind it's super - like this year new. I think it's got great potential because of the multiplayer aspect, my clan is one of the top 10 in the game right now but I'm having more fun playing an idle game WITH people than I ever had with single player ones. Bear in mind I'm a mmo and idle game addict so this does just kinda slot right into my niche but it's still fun and has a good future if the dev continues improving it. Notic how I said \"dev\" and not \"devs\" - from what I've seen it's all one dude making this game"
2189970,1,136581274,Ok for a free game. But very basic and bare bone with tons of missing features expected from modern and advanced factory games.
1409300,1,136579608,"Overall, I’d call Rendezvous a decent effort. It is by no means a bad game – its cyberpunk Indonesia is well-crafted and lovely to look at, and the retro visuals work surprisingly well with the setting’s neon lights and vivid colors. The gameplay is mostly fine, too: some combat-related frustrations aside, I had fun playing detective, solving cool puzzles and sneaking around as I looked for answers and appreciated all the little details of the setting. However, what ultimately prevents me from giving this one a strong recommendation is the underdeveloped and cliché-ridden story, the generally poorly written dialogue and the inconclusive, unsatisfying ending that all hold the project back from reaching its full potential.For more honest indie game reviews, check out our Curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6481290-GTOGG/"
1949030,1,136580432,"To the team at Frogwares: You did it! The game is amazing. Graphics are beautiful and capture the atmosphere of the time and story. The story has been engrossing. I have only played a few hours so far, but if the rest of the game is anything like the beginning it will be a hit in no time. If there were stars here, out of 5... total 5 ;D Kisses to all the Frogwares team!!! You guys rock!! :D"

1772830,1,136579906,"Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game featuring memorable protagonist, Fern, and her snarky sidekick, Puck. Set in a beautiful pixel art world, the game pulls you into a captivating tale of a war between fae and humans. What sets it apart most is the grapple hook mechanic that makes exploring the huge map an absolute blast.The game's immersive story and thoughtully designed world create a atmosphere that keeps you hooked. With memorable characters and an adventure that feels fresh and exciting, Rusted Moss is a must-play for everyone who loves the Metroidvania genre."
2109430,1,136580753,"Beautiful art style, compelling story, and fun puzzles. Bear it one, looking forward to going again and seeing different outcomes based on decisions."
1772830,1,136580820,"Fantastic game, had the pleasure of playing the hell outta the demo and the new content I've played so far has been fantastic"
1772830,1,136580077,I hate kids.
1811990,1,136581942,"This game is a lovely blend of everything I enjoy about both Slay the Spire and Monster Train. If you're a fan of either of those or just enjoy tactical deck-building games, you'll probably love Wildfrost. The art style is incredibly charming, and I can't seem to put it down. Highly recommend."
2216700,1,136581796,its fun when i defeat the boss and he becomes a bigger challenge after leveling upits feels like dark souls in card style although but challenging especially after dying alot i need more cards
2216700,0,136579850,its easy to learn and challenging enough annoyingly truly
1811990,1,136580383,"Amazing roguelike deckbuilder. The art style is very pleasing to the eyes :) Although the game is a bit difficult, it is definitely worth playing through for anyone who's up for a challenge!I LOVE CARD GAMES"
1811990,1,136580758,Lost the first ever daily challenge because i exploded everything including myself. Great game.
1811990,1,136579681,"Incredible game. So much personality, loads of replayability and depth of strategy for such an easily-learned card brawler. I'm a huge fan of Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Vault of the Void - this game is at least as good if not outright better than all of those."
1811990,1,136580382,The game is amazing. Also watched RTGame play this and got hooked
1811990,1,136579102,"Good Game, but Fuck Mokoko. I hate that monkey so much."
1811990,1,136579778,Very cute and fun game
307950,1,136581803,good game
2094270,1,136580033,"This game is very interesting, unfortunately one what I'd call \"Part 1\" of the game has been released. It is very expansive though. I've only gone through the game once and that took about 7 hours. There are a few bugs and several grammatical errors as well as missing words on occasion, but it's not too terrible. I'm looking forward to the release of the next parts in this story. It's all very interesting so I do happily recommend it."

[b]no move limit or rating system[/b], just wreak havoc and move on. the enemy usually also has an arsenal and they're on the same 'timer' that can and should be used to your advantage, along with the game's self-admitted 'not necessarily realistic' physics. it's worth noting that enemy units only activate if there's something to shoot at (they're not bothered by your ballistas because triggering those would destroy their own things) and [b]your goal is to destroy enemy castles, but no problem if other stuff gets demolished too[/b]. maybe those tall towers with red flags are a third party and acceptable collateral damage.I figured with new additions introduced so often, most levels would feel like tutorials, but of course accumulated knowledge has to be used on later puzzles with more and more things, so it's not all a breeze, not for me anyway, and not that much filler either. [b]a puzzle skip option would be nice[/b], so if you get stuck, you're not stuck for good, though somebody's bound to make a guide at some point. level 17 caused the first real problem for me, had to sleep on it, and there were tricky situations later on as well, clever little thing. I gave up on level 30 for now, will try again if they fix the camera, look at this zoomed-in nonsense.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2961080510I really like the presentation but [b]wouldn't mind weather toggles[/b] (clouds, falling snow). no on-screen level numbers ever is always a shame, here it's only on the level select screen. settings are okay and also available while playing, resolutions, windowed mode, languages, graphics quality, an all-important [b]screen shake toggle[/b], and only a single volume slider because [b]there is no music[/b]. surely kevin macleod, composer of all royalty-free music in the world, has some medieval stuff. unfortunately, [b]progress is stored in the registry[/b], which isn't covered by cloud support.it's [b]fun and satisfying, watching things fall apart[/b] (as long as it's not your own life), the [b]level editor with workshop support[/b] might provide longevity if the game gains popularity, and there's even a slight educational element, at least there was for me. catapult, trebuchet, same same, but not anymore. if controls and the camera got some love (it should be 100% mousable and non-qwerty-friendly), it'd be even better, until then it's [b]only recommended on sale[/b]."

You are tasked with growing your garden, and defend it from those who want destroy it...you can use a huge array of weapons and powers and...Nah! Just kidding.

1091920,1,136584504,🌰
1091920,1,136583927,"This game feels just like the first one, while expanding on gameplay options and mechanics. Definitely an 11/10!"
1091920,1,136583894,Cute and relaxing.
2364250,1,136584182,"Such a game should come out on mobile devices, simple, but fascinating. In steam it will have a hard time."
1118110,0,136585018,played game for 33min. didnt understand anything becouse of the bad tutorial. just skip the tutorial and try to understand everything by yourselve. same effect...tutorial told to get a contract and leave the mine. so did i. game crashed to windows -.-do i really want to start this game once more? surely not! they realy have a lot of work to do untill i will be able to enjoy this ALPHA!!!
1949030,1,136585159,"Not too far in yet but having played all of the other Frogware titles, I'm enjoying the mix of Chapter One's mechanics with the more streamlined/single case focus of the older games. Very eager to get back to this, and shout out to Frogwares for putting this together in the middle of a war!"
1949030,1,136583665,Amazing
1919720,0,136583918,Full release with no content update LOL
2156300,1,136585558,Awesome dating sim! Best visuals in this genre of game.
2156300,1,136584681,"For my first actual dating sim game, I thoroughly enjoyed this! Got really invested in the story to see what was happening next, great writing with some great humour (loved the pigeon dialogue)! Can’t wait to see where it goes next!The visuals too… wow. Fantastic models and renders! Roll on Episode 2!"
2285400,0,136584668,"Nope. This is insanely buggy. Couldn't start a game after getting through the 'tutorial' which is nothing more than a sequence of screenshots outside the game. Basically a man page. Not to mention you can't click on anything in the main window, and it completely destroys your multi-monitor layout, moving windows around randomly, resizing stuff and all sorts. Just no. Seems to be completely untested so don't bother with it."
1772830,1,136583040,"This review is written being around 1:30h into the game. I never write reviews until Im done with a game but oh god does this  game feel great. I've been a fan of the metroidvania genre since I played Zero Mission on the gba, we were a bit scrapped for titles for a few years and i was left replaying the older castlevania games mostly. Then came Hollow knight, and absolute masterpiece that reignited my love for the genre like never before and showed a level of care, love and brilliance I'd never seen among it's peers.Since then I've been feeling that itch every few months, a nothing that came out could quite scratch it; Hollow knight inspired games that didn't quite hit the spot and felt just serviceable. Games that might have good exploration, combat or movement but didn't quite bring it all together in my experience. This game is doing it: I'ts fresh, innovative, well designed and above all, it gives you tools to be extremely creative in how you play any given situation. The hook is not a gimmick like in some other games, it's momentum based and a core element of how you're supposed to traverse levels and approach combat, you can even hook enemies that tend to stay away to blast them with your guns. Plot seems interesting, it starts in media res and you start learning about the world characters and your background as you go. Music is good, art is great and the level design seems outstanding. I'll update this when I finish the game, but for now I say: If you're a fan of this genre and you're on the fence about this, just give it a chance, it deserves it."
2216700,1,136584839,nice story writing solid graphics and music with great roguelite mechanics its really pleasing so farim sure veterans of the genre will be pleased
1772830,1,136585857,Played the demo a while ago and the game did not disappoint very very very very good game
1772830,1,136586644,This game is super!!
1811990,1,136586283,"I absolutely adore this game already! Its engaging and consistently difficult, but it hardly feels impossible. I've not yet won a run, with only a few making it past the first boss, but I don't feel frustrated or like i'm making no progress. Not to mention how cute the art style is! This is definitely a game i'm personally gonna sink a lot of hours into and I can't wait to see how it and the community grows!"
1811990,1,136586353,"This is an excellent game, put a ton of hours in to the pre release demo. Just know that this is a progression based game, youre absolutely going to need to unlock items in the village to consistently move forward, you *will die* on your first runs. youre not going to luck into a full game completion, thats now how this is balanced."
1811990,1,136586434,"Very polished, very clean entry in the genre. More streamlined than Slay the Spire or Monster Train, and thus a little simpler, but still very engaging and satisfying. Lots of progression and unlockables. Highly recommend."
1811990,1,136586328,:)
1811990,1,136585898,"I was wanting a tougher roguelite deckbuilder and Wildfrost delivers that, with a beautiful artstyle and excellent sound design, so far I have no issues with the difficulty but after more hours I will come back and update this review."
1811990,1,136586059,"Fantastic so far, definitely has a difficulty curve would advise ignoring people whining about difficulty it's clearly a game that requires some time to master."
1811990,1,136586275,Refreshing and difficult (in a good way!)
1811990,1,136585205,"aint no way every single bad review is a skill issue problem 💀💀. their are a few cards in this game that did not have an \"attacks allies too\" (which imo is a skill issue) and sometimes you will try out a different strategy that relies on turn order that may not work (like an enemy that attacks from, the backlines), but it all comes through experience.  but other than that, this is an great adaptation to slay the spire. 8/10 music, visuals are actually insane, the more i look into the game the more visuals i notice. ayo balance your pets though, some pets are absolutely useless lol. i do love how challenge it is, this way you cant just speedrun your way through the game, and the implications of strategy are just as deep as slay the spire in its own unique way"
1811990,1,136585427,"Made my hero into an unkillable clearing demon with Barrage, Fury, Overburn and most importantly: Smackback.Cleared game without problem.Now he is the final boss and I don't think I will ever clear the game ever again.10/10 would shot myself in the knee again"

307950,1,136586716,"So, I do have a metric sh*tton of hours on the game, but on the launcher. Happy to see it come to Steam! If you are fans of Ghost Recon: Phantoms or the Old SOCOM games, you NEED to try this one out! It's completely free!Video Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqzr2Xob1R0Pros- Almost 70 Operators to Choose from, leading to huge gameplay shifts between matches- Visuals look awesome on Characters, Maps and Weapons- Both PVP and PVE modes (PVE in co-op too) so it has something for everyone!- Map design is simple, but allows for traversal of a few different flank routes- No longer P2W, with the vast majority of Monetization Options tied to Cosmetics and Emotes- Developers who Actually listen to player feedbackCons- There is still a lot of Monetization Options, which get confusing looking through all of the menus- Operator Balancing still needs a bit of work (Explosive Flying Drones and Invulnerable Operators need nerfing)- The time between Battle Passes makes it impossible to get certain Operators without waiting until the next Pass, which may not be for a month or two. Just make them back to back like EVERY. OTHER. GAME. EVER. So we can then get the last season Ops sooner. Weird choice."
307950,1,136586095,Rogue Company meets Arma. As close to Socom on PC as youre going to get.
307950,0,136585148,I love the game and will continue playing it because it brings back the old school Socom/Tom Clancy days but the problem at the moment for Australian players is there's no servers for us not even an Asia server to jump in. This results in 300 ping games and while I can deal with it and have some fun not everyone else will be willing to do the same. I wouldn't even bother asking anyone to download and play it with me because no one will say yes to 300 ping games. Add Asia/Oceania servers if you want these regions to play your game.
307950,1,136585011,Fun game! I have been playing the game before it came to steam. I hope more players pick this up.
307950,0,136586019,"Boring gameplay, Stupid prices for op"
307950,0,136585650,Game sucks massive balls.
307950,0,136583237,This game is ridiculous in a very bad way. Don't waste your time
307950,1,136584273,"Finally on steam, love it."
307950,1,136584373,Good Game !
307950,1,136583210,I have played for over 150 hours on the standalone client before the game came to steam. Highly recommend Caliber if ur a fan of third person shooters or tactical shooter in general.
2133870,1,136582525,"Easily one of the best indie golf games I've played. -tight and simple controls -a power up system that never feels overpowered and has fair cool down system so you can't spam things-stats balance fairly and noticeably change your swing so you can't just pump everything into drive to cheese the game like what happens with so many other indie golf games that try to add Mario Golf GBC/GBA's rpg mechanics-courses feel really carefully planned and the stage hazards really keep things fresh as your stats grow-excellent music-the challenges in single player offer a lot of varietyHonestly, this game is a better Mario Golf than Mario Golf Super Rush is."
2094270,1,136583426,"This was certainly a fascinating experience. The dialogue could get a little esoteric at times, but otherwise the story is great and I cannot wait to see what the next few chapters have in store for us."
2198070,0,136584535,"This game is not entertaining at all. UI is problematic. First of all, there should be some kind of tutorial at the begining to tell me what the heck is going on. Secondly, I guess something is happening at the game as you play, like earthquakes, and buildings being destroyed like its nothing. There is no animation of these buildings collapsing at all, that it seems like a bug.Anyways, this is still an early access game, so I could give another chance when it is completely done."
2198070,1,136586209,"Reminds me of \"Isle of Arrows\" which I also liked a lot. But I found it way harder due to having multiple resources."
2198070,1,136586923,Cute game with very a original premise. Definetly worth a try :P
1893370,1,136586722,"As an UT veteran, I don't know why but this game makes me feel nostalgic and scared at the same time...Check it: https://youtu.be/oNuO2Dnxehw"

1795470,1,136584908,"Okay so while this game might not look like much because of its pixelated graphics. That's actually a good thing.This game is legit. I can't sing it's praises enough.Is it next gen? NahIs it something you can't miss? Nah.But you would still be doing yourself a disservice by not checking it out.You're island shrinks slowly but surely and you needed to accomplish enough objectives so you can move on to the next island, rinse and repeat. Now while it sounds simple and hell...the gameplay is pretty simple for the most part. The game is so well made that I can't get mad at it.It's addictive, it's engaging, it's mysterious, it's challenging (But in a good way) and overall it's just really fun.Probably 6-12 hours of gameplay here (depending on how much you wanna play or accomplish) and for 13 dollars, this kind of gameplay and stability it's a great offer.I Highly recommend this game and even if this isn't normally your type of game I'd still recommend you check it out. It's a resource gathering, upgrade buildings and build up defenses against pirates kinda game. It plays really well, has a decent tutorial and a decent story with everything else about this game being almost perfect for what kind of game it is.But if that still wasn't enough then please check out the video on my YouTube channel (link below) for a more in depth look at the game.Otherwise, thanks so much for reading and I hope I managed to help some of you out there to spend your money wisely.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9cqUYS22us"
1795470,1,136583424,"I just finished my first playthrough - saw the first 4 levels of the campaign (out of the 12 total) and 2 biomes (out of 6). What I really like about this game is the aesthetics and the unique gamplay idea. Each island you're on gets gradually flooded, which means that you have less space to build and need to be smart about building placement. Biomes have different features, so you have to adjust your strategy to individual conditions. You also get different commanders and relics (items) that help you with the challenge. The screen may sometimes get crowded and with many buildings on the island you may need to pay extra attention when moving around, but other than that it's a really fun an enjoyable game! Also, there are 2 modes other than campaign available, but I haven't tried them yet."
2321460,1,136584912,"It's got a nice aesthetic to it with the obvious Hotline Miami vibes.The microchip puzzle mechanic of it is nice, in the original demo you would cut microchips and append them to devices, but in this one there's more of that feeling of taking the plastic face off of a device and undoing its many layers of computer parts to find the one broken with in, it has room for improvement but the meat of a good game is all right there.It's got a strong foundation and a nice Papers Please feel to it. Hope this game goes places.It's very story driven, which isn't a slight but I do hope thats a product of the demo, and in the final product there will be more... mundane store stuff.overall a pretty cozy game about running a repair shop with a killer soundtrack.One of the characters says that the main character should open a coffee shop.. not a bad idea for a game of this nature."
2354600,1,136582660,"Really enjoying this game so far. The game play loop is really addictive, the visuals are beautiful, and it plays really smooth. I'm a big Hotline Miami and Nuclear Throne fan and I'm getting those vibes so far. Definitely worth spending the five bucks and I haven't even seen the movie."
2354600,1,136584919,I think it's a great game about a blood donor or something.idk I haven't played it yet

1527950,1,136586726,"Wartales (finally emerging from Early Access today) is a 3D spiritual successor the Battle Brothers. The premise is similar, you start as a small ragtag band of mercenaries where the only goal is to continue surviving. To do so you must manage your resources like food, money, healing potions, etc. to ensure you can keep surviving.  Battles take place in tactical turn-based style.Pro's- The combat is refreshingly strategic. Your characters don't have an \"order\" they go in, you get to choose which character takes actions in what order (each character goes once per \"round\"). You can have wild swings when you play correctly, or lose a companion if you plan poorly.- The world is well crafted and I particularly like the idea they used with Pitons... essentially you can tie ropes down from steep ledges which can serve as short cuts in the future. More ability to influence the world would be great, but it's a small thing you never got with Battle Brothers.-Professions - Each character can specialize in a \"side job\". This is similar to how Battle brothers allowed you to have skills with non-combat mercs, except now they are tied to your mercs. Some are a bit silly (woodchopping? really?) but I like how these skills are used and breath a bit more life in to your mercs.Neutrals- Region Quests - I really like how each region essentially has a unique \"main questline\" to follow. I think it adds life to the world and allows for you to make decisions on what type of mercenary party you want to be. The reason this is in Neutral is because the execution struggles to deliver in most regions. You can do some of the events out of order (which is fine by itself) however you often miss the backstory on what is happening. For instance, in one region, the quest line is essentially \"Lord A is at war with Lord B\" and that's it. You can do a variety of things to assist one side or the other, but the greater narrative is lacking. Why did they go to war? Why should I support one or the other? Just having an NPC in the town you can get information from would be a great addition.Con's- Combat can be a lengthy experience. If you have a large party (which is encouraged but not required) you will only go up against large parties. I have 13 active companions and will regularly go up against 16 enemies. This makes for long rounds (4 rounds is about average for combat). Especially if it's combat that isn't particularly engaging (wild animals) you can get bogged down. This is especially challenging if you have limited play time.- Difficulty - So this isn't Battle Brothers. Anyone used to tactical turn based combat is going to find \"normal\" difficulty fairly easy. This isn't the negative though, the negative is the implementation of difficulty scaling. You get the option at the beginning to chose Dynamic Scaling (no matter where you go, you will always face approx the same difficulty of enemies) or Region Locked (each region has a set difficulty). My complaint is that trying to implement BOTH of these has resulted in neither being well done. Dynamic Scaling completely takes away any sense of accomplishment or progress. Now I have to fight 18 wolves instead of 5.... while region locking can force grinding to progress. Personally, I highly recommend Region Locked.Overall, I am greatly enjoying the game and highly recommend it. This is a starting point. Battle Brothers took years to get to the state it's in now and I think Wartales has a similarly strong foundation to continue adding content and addressing weakness."
1527950,1,136585922,Now I can finally play the damn game and beat it till the end!  Amazing game
1527950,1,136586739,"This game is fun , give it a try . GL"
1527950,1,136584147,"I played it in early access : Wartales became one of my favorite games. While one could criticise the lack of some equipment (helmets) and sometimes balance issues, you can't deny there is a feeling of adventure in there. You will have to explore a lot, fight a lot, do not starve, go hunting, fishing, mining, stealing, try to find your path. You may take a bandit as a prisonner, and then free him; or whip him to death; or kiss him; or make him your captain; or cut him in pieces and eat him; or perhaps all of these ? I'll give it a tryA lot of options to customize your party, builds and gear, your overall gameplay with more challenging difficulties and starting areas. I like the graphics, the storytelling, the minigames (best of all is the Rouste !!), the way you have to think ahead to build your group as a whole with professions (WHAAATT ? A BARD ??? Yes, my lord, a bard, what song do you want ?).Shiro Games is a company based in my town, I think someday I'll go visit them and pay them my thanks (with a bottle of Edoran wine) for giving me 142,1 hours of good time so far"
1527950,1,136585662,Very fun game. Hits a similar vibe as battle brothers but is a lot less random and more strategic.It also has many more 'realism' elements than battle brothers does.Enjoying it so far.
1527950,1,136584444,Its X-Com but with more features and less pressure set in Medival. Did I mention it was cheaper?*Sad AAA Dev noises
1527950,1,136583884,"Short: An absolute joy.Long: I made my own band of mischiefs. Got beaten up, chased and hated. Came in to some money, some ale and slave chains. Now I´m a respected across the lands as a righteous lord of war. Just as the regular world works. BUT I (Personally) dont have to go to jail or risk my life for it. Fun as F***."
1091920,1,136586540,I've been waiting 7 years for this! Finally able to beat those pesky crows to my liking >:D
1091920,1,136585937,Plantera 1 but with more stuff. 10/10
2207970,1,136587632,so much fun
1934040,0,136586205,Well I would reallllyy want to give a positive but not at the moment of writing this review. The game is lacking and in terms of resources it is way too unbalanced. I am not gonna lie I love the game and all but don't buy it for now wait a bit for content update or when they are gonna be on sale.
1934040,1,136586341,"A great game for preparing for the garden and breeding animals, because summer is coming soon"
1118110,0,136585742,"Ok I really wanted to like this game and was looking forward to it.  I have well over the required minimum specs and it runs terrible on my pc.  Don't even get me started about the loading screens....I could literally drink an entire cup of coffee at my leisure.  I DO recommend this game after they have done a lot of work on it as it WILL be a great game at THAT time.  Right now I would hold off until they put some hours into fixing/improving it.   This game does have great potential.  I mean I played the demo and it was a blast although I did have a few issues, but it's like the release version went backwards.  Even though i'm rather disappointed, I will be keeping my eye on this one and would love to repurchase it later."
2008820,1,136586268,Game of the year!
2109430,1,136588490,"Its worth your money and support to a wonderful studio. I loved the characters and the story, and wanted to play through this story to get every little detail and outcome. However, I could not get past the puzzle aspect and immediately wanted to skip it after the first play through. Not that it was hard, but rather that it became a game of connect the dots more than a puzzle card game. It became rather tedious and frustrating, and as the story got closer to the finish the puzzles got longer instead of harder. To tell the truth I never even learn how the puzzles worked until the very end of my second play though more out of curiosity then need.  It was faster to just connect the dots so to speak then try and figure out the puzzle.  The music was top notch, and the story had me so involved I wished the puzzles were not in the game. overall worth it and I hope to give it another go in a couple days."
2109430,1,136586169,"I love this game. It's just a fantastic story/experience. It's great if you've seen the movies, but you really don't need to watch them to enjoy it. Definitely the best game I've played this year. One of a few games I would recommend to anyone."
2109430,1,136585876,"I'm a huge fan of Tron and I really couldn't believe my eyes when this new game was unveiled at D23 Expo right before my eyes. Fast forward to April 2023: I'm downloading, playing and soaking the game in. It does a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere and vibe of The Grid. The story is captivating and the puzzles in between are a nice change. Oh and the visuals with the music... I could just stare at them for hours!It is a little weird, to not have disc battles or lightcycle races in a Tron game - but this isn't what this game is trying to be. The description, screenshots and trailers make it pretty clear what it is and I think the price tag is pretty fair in that regard.Also, they are working on more Tron projects and I am totally here for the ride! End of line."
2109430,1,136585702,"Pretty cool detective visual novel! This is a game where your decisions matter, and where you always question whether you made the right choice or not. It's pretty short so you can do multiple playthroughs to see what happens if you choose differently.I'm not super familiar with the Tron universe, so some of the lore is lost on me, but I feel like it made it even better for me.  I didn't know who to trust or what to believe, or who was aligned with whom, but the game does a good job at explaining things and giving context, so I never felt lost or overwhelmed. The writing is good, the visuals are great, the music gives a cool vibe.Overall, if you like visual novels, this is a safe purchase and a good experience."
2109430,1,136586063,"Such a fun game with an interesting story. Never played a visual novel type game till now and I know it won't be the last. I had a blast going after all sections of the game and getting all the achievements! Bithell Games, thank you for making this masterpiece of a Tron game."
1498040,1,136586055,Really good stuff here. Lots of unlocks but no meta progression otherwise. Although I prefer meta progression the style of unlocks here work well in place of it. This is one of the peaks of this style of game.  I highly recommend.
1772830,0,136588107,Looks great plays like shit.
1469540,1,136587922,"Believe it or not, I've been waiting a long time for this game. I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], and I enjoyed the mobile game <Maximus 1>, <Super Boys - The Big Fight> and <Black Moor 2> a lot.First of all, it's so good that this game was released on Steam itself, but it seems like it needs constant updates like someone else's opinion. Even if this game doesn't have a point store, I'd like to at least have an achievements or trading card. Also, the full screen didn't apply, so I felt awkward while playing... I agree with others.In other words, I've been waiting for the release of this game for quite a long time, but I don't know the difference with the mobile version. I'm upset that I don't feel rewarded as much as I waited, but on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of Team [Four Fats], so I'll continue to play happily. I sincerely hope one day <Black Moor 2> or the old game <Maximus 1> etc. will be released on Steam! Thank you for reading the long article!"
1811990,1,136588671,"Its cute and charming, but it does have much difficulty to it. I think if it was better balanced out like say giving the varied leader options with more hp and with more healing items it would be better. But I still love everything else about the game and want to see it thrive in time."
1811990,0,136588272,There is a positive in this game - it made me reinstall slay the spire.It's not a roguelite deck builder - it's a randomized auto battler with screwed up balance.
1811990,1,136588263,"Really fun even though i suck at it, music is very good too"
1811990,1,136588650,"Lots of charm, and it's pretty tough as well!"
1811990,1,136587691,Amazing looking and fun to play game!
1811990,0,136588603,Weird difficulty spike
1811990,1,136587620,"I am absolutely in love with Wildfrost! As a fan of both rogue-like games and deck builders, this game hits all the right notes for me. The unique blend of strategic deck building and tactical combat makes for an incredibly engaging and immersive experience.The art style is absolutely gorgeous, and the attention to detail in the game world is stunning. I love exploring and discovering all the hidden secrets that Wildfrost has to offer.But what really sets Wildfrost apart for me is the way it manages to strike a perfect balance between challenge and reward. Every victory feels hard-earned, but also incredibly satisfying. And even when I lose, I feel like I've learned something valuable that I can use to improve my strategy next time.Overall, I can't recommend Wildfrost enough. It's an absolute must-play for fans of rogue-like games and deck builders."
1811990,1,136587645,It`s fun. Looks really nice as well. I am liking it so far.
1811990,1,136587653,This game has cute goats. I love it.
307950,0,136588341,"Can't understand any positive reviews of this, the only fair comparison they seem to make is with a 20 year old FPS which if this had came out then yeah it'd been great but for 2023 it feels like a mobile game. There are no redeeming qualities for this other than it's free.. the gun play and movement have zero weight, the graphics, sounds, and animations seem store bought it's just.. it's all mid."
307950,1,136588798,good 3rd person game
307950,1,136588123,"Surprisingly not bad for a F2P game.The gunplay is a bit weak, but I haven't seen any outright P2W yet which is commendable. It really reminds me of that old Tom Clancy online TPS, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Online, I am not sure if it's as good as that one but I don't think that one had PvE.Oh and did I mention PvE? Yeah, you can play short missions against bots, they are not as good as Insurgency, but again, not bad for a free game.As far as MTX go you can buy operators, skins (skins give bonus exp) and a premium sub that gives more exp/credits.Higher level characters seem to be a bit better, but I haven't played enough to know how good/bad the balance is. So for now I'd say give it a go, I've seen worse multiplayer offerings than this, though I am not sure how long will the gunplay hold your interest."
307950,1,136588083,"It's an OK game.Pros:fun enough game playplenty of ways to playeasy to run in 240 fps, good enough graphicsCons:there are queues to get into matches, which could easily kill the game, I assume there are not enough serversannoying grind and monetization of grindthere is no balance in the co-op missions whatsoever, some are extremely easy while others are extremely hard"
307950,1,136588232,"Game is so damn good, man... Game just came out and I ran 10 hours straight before taking a break. I haven't done that in ages. This is such a breath of fresh air and I'm definitely going to be supporting the devs buy spending a little cash on it. It's quality stuff and for a 35 year old gamer to be gripped this tightly says quite a bit. Kudos to the Devs! See you guys in game!"
307950,1,136588091,"Basically Warface + Rainbow Six Siege and then we got Caliber, I'm not a fan of Tps but somehow I do enjoy this game"
307950,0,136587848,"Russian trash, WHY ARE ABILITES TIED TO STAMINA? Everything P2W"
307950,1,136587747,"A great and well executed concept, very unique, it stands out from the mass.Also, it's developed by a russian company and it's completely free, it deserves your time."
307950,1,136587714,went online. got handed my pitiful back pretty instantly. there are tactics grandmasters here baiting you into their traps. 10/10 would try again.

2198070,1,136587302,"çok beğendim, tebrikler"
1527950,1,136589024,Did 2 solo playthroughs at different point of the early access and can't wait to play the 1.0 version. Heard the coop experience can still be buggy for some people so I would test that during the first 2 hours if you're planning to play with a mate.
1527950,1,136588258,"If Mount & Blade and Expedition series had a baby, this would be it. Lovely game. Feels polished enough. Give it a chance on sale."
1527950,1,136588928,Oh look...Kenshi and X-Com had a baby...
1527950,1,136587976,"This is a pre-1.0 release reviewSo I picked this game up towards the very end of it's EA cycle and I have to say I was impressed, If you're a fan of the Expeditions games, or Battle Brothers or any of those kinds of games, this is for you. It's a very competent turn based strategy and managing your party is simple, but still provides a good challenge when it comes to weighing up who gets healed, who's armour are you going to fix, will you devote some of your precious resources to crafting certain items etc. I had a lot of fun, I put just short of 30 hours in pre-1.0 and I'm sure I'll put in a lot more now it's fully released"
1527950,1,136587902,"Game is good, and fun.It doesn't have a central \"plot\" or goal aside from \"Get strong and rich\" and is very open ended, but also can get quite repetitive (I absolutely do not recommend Region-Locked mode as fights can get as long as 40 minutes with how many units there can get).It doesn't have the strategic depth of something like Mount & Blade Warband or mechanical depth of Battle Brothers, but it's a decent in-between."
1527950,1,136587893,This game is something really fresh. I like the approach to strategy and atmosphere. A lot of positive moments and fresh decisions. I recommend at least to try this game.
1527950,0,136587796,"Hot garbage.Better looking but still a shallow, downgraded version of Battle Brothers.Its so boring that its not even fun with friends.Avoid at all cost."
1091920,1,136588165,This game locks away the pain and suffering in life by being just the best game of all time.
1091920,1,136587268,Hello gamers <3This game is very friendly <3 i love that cute soundtrack with those little blue helpers ! you have a lot of to do to make them smile !! so dont let them wait for your gardening <3 Soundtrack is absolutely amazing - simple tones full of relax Gameplay is more better then in Plantera 1 (more interactive events) so dont wait and buy it !!
1091920,1,136587427,"Like Plantera but with so much extra stuff. Very pleasant idle game, with more stuff compared to the original. Love that my progress from the playtest carried over as well to the full release."
1091920,1,136587243,i love it! so cute!! <33
