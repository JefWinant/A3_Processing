Soon you notice the ability of creating more squares of terrain around you, and do so to expand the world map itself. There‚Äôs no story or lore to speak of, other than you have to survive in the wilderness by any means necessary, as the night is dangerous, while the day is peaceful.   As much as sandbox games can be far from being story-oriented, the complete absence of any narrative element is a strong malus when there isn‚Äôt enough variety to compensate for it. The world itself is composed of tiles belonging to various biomes, each has a colorful and vibrant palette, but also feels static; there are no changes in the weather, and no interactions between confining climates or between animals, monsters and plants. Like a diorama with a few moving parts.  [h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3] You‚Äôll explore the world you yourself create on foot, or later on via mounted animals. Speaking of expansion, each new day will have you choose some ‚Äúcards‚Äù belonging to different biomes, to then place them as tiles to expand the map. Each climate has different animals and resources, so varying the composition is fundamental to access all materials for crafting.   The sense of discovery typical of an open-world survival is largely lost and washed-out, as even after many days the explorable world, including the underground level and the ‚Äúenchanted dimension‚Äù, all matching in size, will still be small in size. You won‚Äôt even need a map for orienteering, and there isn‚Äôt one. As you roam these tiny expanses, you won‚Äôt witness interesting random events, rare spawns or other points of interest spawning at any point. The best you‚Äôll get are goblin traders that you can shelter and house in your base, or animals to kill or capture and breed. The interest wanes after only a couple of hours, as you‚Äôll have seen everything by then.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960459835  [h3]Combat System[/h3] At night, monsters will spawn on any non-player made tile. The inside of your (hopefully) walled base is safe, but outside the hordes are relentless. Enemies vary per biome: for instance the ice biome will have evil snowmen, the underground caves have explosive spiders, and the enchanted dimension have floating, energy-shooting abominations. The way to defeat each foe  is always the same: kite them in a circle and keep slashing in melee, or wait between shooting patterns for ranged enemies. All of them have one attack pattern and follow mostly the same archetype, with minimal variations.  Your choice of weapons is limited to swords, throwing spears or, if you grind trader reputation enough, slings. Each of them has a single attack, with the sling capable of flinging various crystals and bombs as an exception. Enemies become repetitive and stale not after long, while the combat system simply doesn‚Äôt have the depth to keep being engaging. No armors, accessories, upgrades, unique weapons and so on are present at any point. Blocking? Parry? Dodge? Anything? Nah, forget it. Minecraft‚Äôs combat system is Dark Souls in comparison to Miniland Adventures.  [h3]Crafting & Base Building[/h3] You‚Äôll use four main workbenches to get anything done, from flooring to utility buildings, weapons and furniture. The crafting system is the typical one of any open-world survival, requiring you to have a certain amount of basic and processed materials to make a finished product.   There‚Äôs no further elaboration or novelty to it. The economy is kinda broken, to the point I never used anything else than stone tools and Ruby (like Minecraft‚Äôs diamond) swords, as metal tools lasted too short compared to the effort to grind the materials to make new ones. Expect to take some time to have a spacious base with all the bells and whistles, even if most craftables are purely decorative or gimmicky - you won‚Äôt need them, unless you want to upgrade trader reputation by placing them in their rooms, which isn‚Äôt worth it anyway.  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2960460780  [h3]Trading & Farming[/h3] Traders offer wares locked behind reputation tiers, gained by furnishing their rooms in specific ways. Some of these items can‚Äôt be obtained in any other way, however none of them is really worth the effort. The system exists and is even a decent concept, but has no incentive to be used.   Farming works in a classic way: plant crops, water them daily or use an automated sprinkler, reap the fully-grown produce and repeat. Of course, some plants may only grow in certain soils or biomes, while animals won‚Äôt need care but eat specific vegetables to breed and have more to harvest, like sheep for wool to make an example."
2349990,1,136559985,"Really nice game, great story and Graphics."
1949030,1,136559936,"An excellently crafted remake which is well worth your time.Pros:- Intriguing story which will push you to play until you solve the case.- Well-written characters and dialogues, accompanied by superb voice acting. - Beautifully designed and diverse locations which you'll enjoy exploring.- Excellent atmosphere.Cons:- Semi-open areas feel empty regarding gameplay, as they only serve as a stage for the actual locations you need to visit.- Facial animations are not up to modern standards.- There are no real challenges or puzzles, as everything is streamlined, and you will barely have any trouble solving puzzles and combining clues."
2349550,1,136560296,My word was Proud.Glad another game from The Test Series was released. I  recommend playing this game and The Test: Secrets of the Soul; if you haven't already. I can't wait for more to come!
2166050,1,136559684,A really well designed little puzzle platformer. Great level ideas without repetition or any mechanic overstaying it's welcome. Lovely pixel art and pleasant tunes too!
1949030,0,136559763,"No, it's still not on the level of Crimes and Punishments. It appears Frogwares just doesnt effin get it. We want the games to be more like C&P NOT what came after it. The design mistakes of The Sinking City and Chapter One are still present though they seemed to have realized the eavesdropping and combat sucked so they have been removed. Once again, you are asked to make choices on guesswork since they could really go either way, things will not be visible because you werent on the right viewmode or were not highlighting the the right clue. Yes, the silly pinning mechanic is still here, and the game wants to be a sequel to Chapter One, constantly referencing it. Chapter One was a mistake that should be forgotten, not referenced multiple times within the first minutes. You already have a foundation to build on, it's called Crimes and Punishments. The mind map has been simplified yet again, and in a more frustrating way that tells you what kind of clues to select and how many, in a much less intuitive or interesting way than select posibilities enabling a logic train of thought like the one in C&P and TDD. The new Mind Map is also ripe for frustration and bruteforcing as you will frequently know what the answer is, just not what evidence it wants as the chain of thought that leads to it (a common problem of detective games), or you know onlt the logic train to an answer and it comes out of Sherlock's ass since the player could not have pieced the finan deduction from the clues. I'm supposed to BE Sherlock, not WATCH and nudge Sherlock. This is not a Watson game.Also, in that respect, the Imagination mechanic still solves the whole thing for you. You play a game of ordering very vague but still chronologically simple to follow events, but then Sherlock fills in all the blanks sometimes with plenty of information you didnt glean at all or couldnt be sure of. The character does the detective work instead of the player who gets to play a minigame and watch. Yaaaay. And once again, side cases either dont get a mind map at all or get an even more simplified one.Oh, and in a cruel twist of UX, the archive is now accesed by looking at clues. I bet many returning players will try to access it by frantically pacing around the two inches of 221B you can move through repeatedly befroe realizing that. I'm beginning to think the game lacked playtesting.I'll probably finish it as I'm out of other games but if you were hoping for a return to form, sorry, no. It seems whomever is in charge now plain and simply doesnt get the appeal of the best detective game they made, and has no interest in building on it. They like what I consider to be their worse games too much and will continue on the path they laid foward in them. Shame. Chapter One was a mistake and they are happy to keep making it. Fire whomever is in charge of CO and this pseudo remake and get the people in charge of C&P back on board for the next one.P.S: Credit where credit is due, the game is really well optimized and while the animations are lacking, the character models for Sherlock and John are great."
1949030,1,136559848,"This year has been a great period for horror game remakes between Dead Space and RE4, and now even Frogwares seems to be getting on board that train. If you aren't familiar with the older games in this series (like the one this is a remake of), you should know that despite this sharing a lot of the DNA of Chapter One, it isn't an open world game. There are a few small hub areas with occasional small diversions, and if you get the side quest dlc there's some side stuff to do throughout the first half of the game, but for the most part it's more like a traditional point-and-click adventure game campaign (which I consider a substantial plus, considering how poorly their attempts at open world games went). It's adjusted to be less inventory focused in favor of more of the modern investigation gameplay, but the main campaign is essentially one big \"case\", and it took me around 11 hours to get through everything. Its adherence to the original material comes as a slight detriment in some parts, because the pacing around the middle of the game was kind of a mess back then and to some extent it still is here, but a lot has been done to tidy things up and smooth over the rough edges. The writing is all around improved, the tone is more consistent across the board, and the story and puzzles have been changed up for the better. And compared to Chapter One, it's honestly just really nice to have Watson back again; I went into their previous game with an open mind towards Jon, but he just didn't have half the chemistry that these two have. There aren't any of Chapter One's unsolvable \"no right answer\" choices, and you never have to gun down a room full of enemies! It's just a fun game all around for mystery fans, and while it's not enough that I don't still miss the Crimes & Punishments style of gameplay and deduction, it's a level of compromise I'm happy to work with.The original Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened was always a fairly substantial departure from what was normal for this series, injecting all sorts of horror and mysticism into the otherwise fairly grounded universe and then daring you to call it non-canon by bolting itself to the timeline with a single key plot element. I thought for sure that this would end up being more of a reimagining than a remake as a result, with it seeming to position itself as an official sequel to Chapter One, but it doesn't -- if anything, it gets even weirder at some moments, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
1949030,1,136559933,"Really good remaster for the classic Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened. It follows the same story as the original, which is one of the key advantages in the original, but there are many different new side quests, and the areas are larger so they can be explored better."
2060670,0,136560732,"It starts off promising enough, but having played the full release, I just don't know why you would play this over almost any other competent release in the new genre.The graphics are neat, and there are a lot of interesting things presented - talents on level up that unlock a new set of talents, choosing your starting basic weapon, the watering thing is neat and the building stuff seems interesting. The problem is, you don't get to interact with it at all. You choose from 4 options on level up, and that includes \"potions\" which are basically temporary buffs. The pool of talents is MASSIVE, and not weighted (as far as I can see). You get 2 rerolls per floor, which amounts to about 8 rerolls per run, which is basically useless for actually trying to do \"a build\". If you choose one of those \"class\" talents that unlock more options (mechanic, ki, etc.) it gets even worse.Basically all the choices are worthless because, like all these genre of games, you need synergy and multiplicative power to survive, which means just take the most basic, passive stat upgrades, and the basic fish summon skills, and do the same thing every run because everything else requires a staggering amount of luck in your favor to see work. You can experiment on the lowest tier difficulty a bit but even then you'll often just run into not killing stuff fast enough which means less xp which means less leveling which means killing stuff slower which means spending 5 minutes after the end of the level timer dodging endlessly while you whittle away the hp of the boss (or you could go onward and forsake even more xp). Oh also you obviously get WAY less rewards at the basic tier. Also unlocking higher tiers requires beating the previous tier, which means doing incrementally less forgiving runs over and over using the same builds over and over because anything else could mean wasting 15-20 minutes of your time and not knowing it until the choices keep failing to happen.There is a fun game hidden here behind the insane lack of meaningful choices presented to the player. If the level up options were like, 8 choices instead of 4, it would STILL be more RNG than most of these games, but it might be more friendly to try out other builds. There's just no reason to recommend this because it's closer to playing a tedious slot machine than a bullet heaven."
2156300,1,136560024,"They clearly said Unscripted was going to different from their other game.  And it is.  It has more depth,  more characterization, more backstory, more interactions. Your MC has to actually work at developing a relationship with a female character  that wants more out of life. It's not a ridiculously stupid AVN,  which is the typical  visual novel genre,  but the audience for those stories are immature frat-boys or really damaged misogynists. It took just about two hour to play through the story,  and the price might be a little steep for the one chapter,  but if we're getting additional chapters later on,  it'll be worth the investment. The art is good and the dialogue writing is well developed as well."

Set in a wasteland once inhabited by humans, this game provides a challenging and immersive experience that allows users to feel in complete control of their character.[h1][b][2] Game Experience[/b][/h1]The game's twin-stick shooter aspect emphasizes tight and precise gunplay, with players quickly switching between their arsenal of weapons to best suit their playstyle and situation. Players can get up close and personal with a shotgun before grappling away and pulling out a sniper for the killing blow.The grappling hook is the standout feature of the game, which takes some time to learn but is ultimately rewarding to master. The physics-based elastic grappling hook allows players to latch onto any moss-covered structure and swing their way through the rugged terrain. The freedom created by the controls creates a smooth experience, allowing for creative solutions to flexible traversal challenges.The game offers a challenging experience, with powerful witches and machine monstrosities as the bosses. Each boss fight throws its own unique challenge at the player, requiring them to push their gunplay and grappling hook skills to their limits. Players must dodge swords, avoid energy fields, and blast away at conjured spiders to progress.The game features beautifully melancholic pixel art with a retro vibe and modern aesthetic, bringing the world of Rusted Moss to life with moody pixels and stylish animation. The game also offers customizable strategy and gameplay, multiple endings, and encounters with humans and fae folk who are trying to find their way through the world.[h1][b][3] Verdict [/b][/h1]In conclusion, Rusted Moss is a fantastic metroidvania game that provides a challenging and immersive experience with its physics-based grapple, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and engaging story. The game's pixel art and aesthetic add to the overall experience, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.[h1][b]Side Note : [/b][/h1][code]Looking for nice STEAM games?

1772830,1,136563095,the game seems great but because of my disability i need to rebind mouse clicks. is there anyway to add that option please? without that im basically stuck at the grapple part.
1469540,1,136563192,"A fantastic beat em up!With a little more work on making it more than just a mobile port (Steam Achievements, trading cards, Full screen), this could be one of the best beat em ups on Steam."

2299240,1,136561680,Supper funny. Smashies for Ogre Thadeus! Fated Word: LifeNow to play again and choose a different fate.
1118110,1,136561484,Only 7 hours in and have finished the tutorials and am now on my own. Great concept and am enjoying the game. Everything is maxed out and have not had any stutter or lag issues I have seen others report. Here is my take so far:Pro:1- Game looks nice and runs smooth (for me).2. Good concept but could be lacking longevity or replayability.3. 3 different mines on the map and map is large although a lot of wasted spaceCons:1. A lot of the controls are not really explained clear enough- especially when it comes to assigning haulers to diggers. Make sure you assign the hauler first then the digger or you will waste a ton of resources.2. When it comes to the second and third mine- to load the cargo onto the barge or train- make sure you hit the Q and E key to open and close the scoops. Also was not clear.3- The drill rig was also very confusing at first- but the arms can rotate outwards much further than it appears. You just have to keep moving them in a circle format to fully extend them. Might be easier on controller but on keyboard it was a chore. 4. My biggest complaint and an issue I might be overlooking:Workers do not seem to continue to work if you are not in the mines. At least it seems that way to me. So not much reason to have all 3 mines working. As there is no fast travel and it takes for ever to travel between mines- I think I am going to sell all the machines at the first mine and just concentrate on either the 2nd or 3rd mine. Someone could clarify if I am missing something here.Anyway- that is my 2 cents- thanks for taking the time to read it.
1949030,1,136562801,"While not being far into the game yet, it does a good job at setting up the stage and telling at atmospheric story in a Lovecraftian environment, but Sherlock Holmes style.There's the mind castle where you can solve the cases, but you need to gather clues first. They can be items, conversation topics or just observations. Then there's two difficulties, one which helps the player a little bit in finding clues, and the other one which doesn't.I do regularly Let's Play horror (and especially indie horror) games on my YouTube channel. If you want to check out the gameplay, or maybe watch the whole thing, look no further: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGx6OkjLuhs"
1949030,1,136562691,"The narrative is fantastic if you are a fan of Sherlock and Lovecraft however the game is not as big as the previous game, Sherlock Holmes: Chapter One but I honestly cannot complain. The devs did an amazing job and I have not experienced any bugs during this day one release.It can be played as a standalone game but I highly recommend playing Chapter One as well!"
2109430,1,136562012,"TRON LIVES! ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS TRON LIVES! YOU CLU WORSHIPING SONS OF BITCHES AIN'T GOT NOTHING ON TRON! Seriously, all-in-all, music is absolutely wonderful. Story is captivating while adding new elements to Tron Lore. My only complaint is how short the story is and how repetitive the 'de-frag' mini-game is. Otherwise, solid 9/10."
2109430,1,136561261,"Though this game is short (I completed my first run in a little over 3 hours) it's clear that a ton of thought and love was put into it. The artwork is gorgeous, the characters intriguing, the puzzles are fun (usually), the soundtrack slaps, the writing is accessible while still keeping that Tron flavor, and best of all as soon as the credits roll I'm left wanting to know more. Here's hoping this is the neon noir beginning to a whole new era of Tron.tl;dr if you like Tron and you like visual novels, you will be delighted by this game"
2109430,1,136561465,Short and sweet! Voice over would have been really appreciated but the visuals and sound scape was truly amazing and Tron worthy. Glad someone is still trying to keep the Legacy alive ;-)
2109430,1,136561253,"It's a well-done short story that brings you back to the Grid.All my criticisms are variations of \"I wish it was longer\" / \"I wish we got more time to know and interact with these characters\"; it was about a 3-hour playthrough my first time, and you can certainly speed through it much faster after you've gone through once. I think getting all the achievements today I played it 6 or 7 times total, doing all the puzzles each time, and altogether that took maybe 10 hours.If you're interested at all, definitely pick this up. It's worth it, and it helps support and encourage the developer while they work on the sequel(s) already underway to continue the story (and shows Disney that good Tron content is worth investing in).I'm still going to do another playthrough or two to see if there certain outcomes I can get, so yeah, I definitely recommend it!"
694990,1,136561893,Nice update! I like it better then the first one.
2156300,1,136562411,"The plot is promising, has not yet passed the game completely, but I want to write an early review. I liked the gameplay, the general immersion in the game and even the interface looks very harmonious, so you can relax during the game and play with a cup of coffee."
2156300,0,136562281,"This review is not because I want a refund but I do want to see future episodes well maybe I like watching Car Crashes in the Highway. Spoilers AHEAD. Number 1.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR NAKED WOMEN AND BASIC PORN GO AWAY ( i believe there is no naked tag on the game ). I would like to say though even Nicholas Sparks does steamy sex in his books/movies it did not hurt him but that is not what the development team is going for (you can portray Intimacy with nudity and not be pornographic, sex sells ). No 2. Price point in 2009 Minecraft was sold for 13 dollars ( you can google this ) so is Unscripted.. do not expect Minecraft level of play ability. No 3. I ran into Saving problems while I was save scumming all the possible options to get all the possible 4 vibes which i only did 3 romantic / dreamer / Joker. (fixed by turning off the game and turning it on again ) No. 4 I got some flashing white blank in the middle of the screen during some scenes. which only appeared a few times but still annoying. also Trying to keep track of the Vibe changes seems to have stopped after the Demo version of the game. also the relationship points for ( trust ) the River char. only seemed to show during the first episode. making everything you did before demo and after demo not integrated. i.e you will go on a date with River no matter how bad you fucked up. No. 5 Second girl ( i think the name was angela lol ) during the pitch meeting seems more filler at this point to express how shitty the MC's life really is and the whole important choice there really was not that important but to give you different ways you can react to rejection / opportunity. No. 6 At least the most of the Graphics as far as i can tell ( yes i breeze thru alot of AVN ) are not recycled or horribly out of human proportions. but  i think they can do better.. ( they could have made the mc character more pleasant looking maybe not like Tom Cruise or Zac Efron but just a little more leading man like also why does not he look like his bro. ? he adopted? ) No 7. (im trying to get to ten but should have stopped at 5.) The sound Still comes on when i turn on the game even when i muted it on a previous run thru it didnt remember my settings from past run? ( ya im nitpicking at this point i know ) No. 8. one of the other reviews Said not enough save slots i didnt believe till i started scumming to try to get all the possible Vibes so yes this is the truth on that matter. No. 9 ( almost there ) During the Sex Scene you asked if you want to skip it and manually control it some how that part still buggy because i clicked no to not skip and yes to control it and it skipped. ( ya i know its a bug? still buggy at launch? dont worry i played 7 days to die thru what felt like 10 years of early access and ya that shit i still play today still buggy as hell or id like to think of it as a feature ) No. 10 Finally with all the bad things i might have said i would still wait to see how it ends up i been waiting for VTM Bloodline 2 since what 2019? at least Unscripted actually is out."
2349550,1,136564417,Gifted word -Victorious The watcher's words hit the spot in this game. I liked the little snippet of the mirror scene from Fateweaver too.

1685730,1,136563682,"This is a very charming game that lost all of its identity by patching in combat. Why would I sneak and craft vision-hindering arrows if I can solve every situation by just killing them? By giving the player a choice, they have honestly made it worse. The game wasnt designed for combat to begin with and it doesnt make alot of sense. The voice actress of Cynthia is extremly overplaying her part, sometimes it sounds good, sometimes its pretty cringe-worthy. Nevertheless, this is still a good little indie gem, that is rough around the edges but has a ton of heart going for it. Just dont expect anything special. Would have loved to give this a mixed review, since it doesnt deserve a negative one but also not a positive one due to the whole combat situation.

1772830,1,136563948,"Played the demo completely through twice and instantly wanted more. Bought it the moment it went available and it has not disappointed at all.The grapple hook is one of the best in the biz, feeling a lot like Umihara Kawase in the way that it acts a lot more like a bungee cord than something you'd see in a game like Bionic Commando.The story so far has been really engaging and I want to know more and more about the world and characters. Soundtrack is great, and the world makes me want to go back to areas to see what I can do with new abilities.Legit the best Metroidvania I've played since Hollow Knight."

1811990,1,136566127,"Wildfrost does a great job at breathing new life into the Roguelike Deckbuilding genre. With several developers putting their own spin on the Slay the Spire formula this game feels like the first movement in the right direction. Great art, great concept. I can't wait to sink my teeth into all this game has to offer"

1811990,1,136565722,"If you like roguelike deckbuilders and want a challenge you don't want to miss this!The game is tough and your deck needs to have solutions for every situation, deckbuilding is much more complicated than just filling your deck up with matching keywords/synergies and winning the run on sheer power. It's worth noting that all of the battles in each run are interesting rather than the \"filler\" battles which many similar games feature.Finally the theme/artwork are top notch and there is plenty of content to unlock to give the game some longevity!10/10, A+"
1811990,1,136565829,Addictive game with a fun learning curve. The runs themselves are nice and short but there is a lot of replayability as there's plenty to unlock and different strategies to discover.
1811990,1,136565341,There is gnome booty.Must buy.
1811990,1,136565219,"Here I am, at 4 AM. I am one of the first to buy this game on it's full release date.Love this game. Everything is handcrafted to form the perfect roguelike deckbuilder experience.I know I don't have much time on the game currently, but I know I'll spend a lot of time playing this. I've been keeping up with this game for a REALLY long time. I am so glad to finally see it come to fruition."

307950,1,136565224,"(I have far more playtime through the standalone launcher prior to the Steam release.)First and foremost, allow me to say that Caliber hasn't always been the game that it is now. If you have ever heard anything negative about this game, chances are those things no longer exist. The developers have been very open and willing to listen to the community in order to make this game worthwhile. And with that said, Caliber is certainly a game worth playing.If you've ever played Ghost Recon Phantoms or SOCOM, Caliber is basically the spiritual successor to these classic third person shooters. There are a ton of unique operators to pick from, team based gameplay in which each person fills in their own role, fun co-op missions, various game modes, and no P2W. If you're a fan of third person shooters, tactical shooters, or shooters in general, you absolutely should give Caliber a try.As someone that has been playing games since the early 90s, I would like to thank the developers for not only listening to the community in order to improve this game, but for making such a game to begin with. Caliber offers up a nostalgic experience, harkening back to a time when shooters weren't mindless, and horribly generic. You've done good, 1C. Keep it up!"
307950,1,136566892,"I played the Caliber since early beta and, as one can see in my achievements list, collected nearly all content available for now. And what can I say about pros and cons of this game.Pros:+A lot of game modes, both PvP and PvE. Not all of them are equally populated but you can find a match even in not so popular modes pretty fast.+Over 60 characters to choose from. Different operators offer different playstyles, some are good for mowing down bots, some are perfect for PvP.+Nice visuals with decent system requirements.+No 'pay2win' - all operators can be purchased with ingame currency (and you don't need to grind for weeks to buy one you like).Cons:-Visual customisation system are lacking. You can apply different camos to the operator but most ot it can be obtained only during events or for premium currency. Nearly all of the skins with really unique looks are premium.-Leveling up the operator can be tiresome - later levels require lots of XP and credits to grind.Summary: good 'heroic shooter' in realistic setting with lots of coop and competitive activities. It's good to see it on Steam at last."
307950,1,136565585,"Ok, here we go (been waiting for this since 2019)Remember Ghost Recon phantoms? SOCOM? Any third person shooter that relies on teamwork?This is game made for fans of that, if youre BF or CoD player coming here with \"Oh it doesnt have first person\" move along this aint for you anyway.As a third person shooter this game has it everything you need to enjoy, while animations arent top notch like in GR Breakpoint, this game does it decent enough.Guns feel good and different.There is one problem that new players might enncounter and that is famous grind.New players might get overhelmed by amounnt of grind u need to put out, but this is better system thann it was before, where you would have to buy new operators only with gold (each week u would get 3 new operators that would b availeble for blue credits).All to all - You like third person? You have time? Dont mind a grind? GO FOR IT!!!....and yeah, learn Russian!"
307950,1,136566050,Played it before it came to Steam.It's like an Ubisoft (The Division/Siege) game but without it's biggest flaw - being made by Ubisoft.
307950,1,136564937,good socom like finally on steam pog
307950,0,136565139,just play rogue company
307950,0,136564866,Shity mobile port
307950,1,136564863,Been playing this game since before it launched on Steam. There's really nothing like it in terms of 3rd person shooters. If you can get past some of the grind and slight balancing issues it can be a very chill shooter to pass the time with. Really fun game.
307950,1,136564796,"So far, so good"
2094270,1,136565458,"Lightracer Spark is a visual novel set in a Sci-Fi world. It's pretty much a narrative game where your choices matter as you progress through story. There are also some strategy elements, such as building various buildings, collecting resources, implementing space stations modules etc. I have to say that this game really surprised me how well made it is. Story/Narrative:I have to say that story is quite well written and everything is connected with each other. There is a lot of text to read, a lot of choices to make. Currently you can only play Chapter 1 (new chapters will come as DLCs) that has many mini chapters in it, and as you progress the story, you're able to learn a lot about who you are, what is your mission and what you're capable of doing. Prologue is some sort of Tutorial that shows you and teaches you how to play the game. The other chapters are specific stories that tell you about certain events. Now, the biggest pat of this game is that as Amender (controller of planets and universes) you have specific traits that influence the story. You can pick between 5 different paths and each brings unique traits and bonuses. In the story there will be some choices that you can complete and they have difficulty, ranging from very easy to very difficult. They do somewhat influence the story as it makes you get different ending and you don't collect all the information needed but the higher traits you have, the easier it is to complete them. For example, you'll have to talk about history of certain civilization and to complete that choice, you'll need decent knowledge on \"Strange Worlds\" that is a specific trait in the game. All in all, I have to stay that story is quite unique and it does get you hooked but I just wish that developers added the button that you can speed up the text since most of the time you yourself have to click Continue in order to progress through story and text is quite slow which leaves you enough time to read everything.Strategy elements:I personally think strategy elements don't influence the game that much. Yes, you have to collect resources such as energy points, technology points and population in order to complete some chapters, but at the same, you collect those quite fast and buildings are quite cheap to build. You can also upgrade them which allows you to gain resources faster. There are special buildings that do require some effort to build, and they bring you various bonuses and materials that are later required to build certain buildings. In general, it's not time consuming but you'll sometimes forget that they even exist or forget to upgrade them since you're mostly focused on the story. There is also war in this game. I personally think it's quite unfair for other provinces and countries to get attacked by you. Because you're technologically stronger and the higher population you have, the easier it is to recruit troops. Enemies are quite easy to kill and they won't pose a threat. I think it's more beneficial to just focus on your military rater than pure resources. Issues:Even though the story is quite well written, music and images are well made, I can't suggest this game for everyone. First of all, the mechanics of the game are quite easy to master and the game doesn't offer much content. Yes this is visual novel, but at the same time developers could have given us something more unique to do in between the stories and the stories progress way toooo fast. As soon as you're done with one mini chapter, you can instantly go to the other. As I already mentioned, building and waging war isn't anything special and it really doesn't bring you much. Time in the game can be slowed down or fastened up. If you have enough time to read through chapters and chapters of the story and you really do like to immerse yourself in futuristic world where AI helps you with everything, then surely this game is for you.  Overall score: 7.5"
